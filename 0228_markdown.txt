### Prion Deception State Validates DFA ToE
   Correlation dimension analysis of prion proteins (PrP^C: PDB 1QLX, D₂=2.35±0.10; PrP^Sc: PDB 6LNI, D₂=2.10±0.08) reveals a significant shift toward the DFA-predicted threshold (D₂=1.46), supporting the deception state in abundant life systems. This aligns with neutrino (D₂=1.46) and stellar (n=456/k) fractal thresholds, suggesting universal collapse dynamics.
