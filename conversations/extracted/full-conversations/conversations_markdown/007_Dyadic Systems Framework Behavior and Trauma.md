The revised **Dyadic Systems Framework** outlines a model for understanding human behavior through the interplay of two primary axes, their states, and resulting dynamics, driven by the core needs of group access and survival. Below is a summarized and corrected version of the framework based on the provided document, addressing apparent OCR errors (e.g., "Truma-wraped" as "Trauma-warped," "PATTEA" as "PATTERNS," etc.) and removing redundant repetitions for clarity.

### **The Dyadic Systems Framework**

#### **Primary Axes**
1. **Structural Axis**: Direct force application to manipulate the environment for group access and survival.
   - Characteristics: Observable actions, creates immediate accountability, requires internal control systems (discipline, order, structure), and enforces self-limitation due to visibility.
2. **Relational Axis**: Indirect force application to manipulate the environment for group access and survival.
   - Characteristics: Less visible, relies on influence and social dynamics.

#### **Axis States**
1. **Authentic**: Natural, healthy expression aligned with genuine needs for group access and survival.
2. **Trauma-Warped**: Corrupted expression due to developmental trauma, leading to maladaptive behaviors.
3. **Mimicked**: Performed or fake expression used for manipulation, lacking genuine intent.

#### **Trauma Patterns**
1. **Fighter**: Trauma-warped Structural Axis.
   - Uncontrolled direct force, driven by a "get them before they get me" mindset.
2. **Charmer**: Trauma-warped Relational Axis.
   - Uncontrolled indirect influence for personal gain, often manipulative.
3. **Ghost**: Both axes punished or underdeveloped.
   - Invisibility as a survival strategy, avoiding engagement with either axis.

#### **System Dynamics**
1. **Generative Tension**: Productive opposition between Structural and Relational axes, creating space for growth and adaptation.
2. **Subsystems**: Nested structural and relational dynamics within larger systems, influencing behavior at multiple levels.
3. **External Connections**: Outside supports or pressures that affect system resilience and functionality.

#### **Core Drive**
1. **Group Access**: Fundamental need for inclusion in social systems.
2. **Survival Concern**: Basic drive to maintain existence and safety.

#### **Predatory Patterns**
1. **Apex Predator**: Masters both axes without authentic constraints, using them for exploitation or extraction.
2. **Ideological Warping**: Manipulating authentic drives to produce inauthentic behaviors, often for control or gain.

#### **Temporal Context**
1. **Present Survival Pressure**: Immediate needs override long-term optimization, prioritizing short-term survival.
2. **Dimensional Perspective**: Different awareness of time influences decision-making and behavior.

#### **The Visibility/Accountability Split**
- **Structural Axis (Visible)**: Actions are observable, leading to immediate accountability where success or failure is apparent.
- **Relational Axis (Less Visible)**: Actions are subtle, less accountable in the immediate term, relying on influence over direct action.

#### **Core Principle**
All human behavior flows from the interplay of these core systems, seeking group access and survival through authentic or corrupted force application, shaped by the visibility of actions and the tension between immediate needs and long-term goals.

### **Key Observations**
- The framework emphasizes the duality of direct (Structural) and indirect (Relational) strategies for achieving group inclusion and survival.
- Trauma distorts natural expressions, leading to maladaptive patterns (Fighter, Charmer, Ghost).
- Predatory patterns exploit the system’s dynamics, while temporal context highlights how survival pressures and time awareness shape behavior.
- The Structural Axis’s visibility enforces accountability, requiring internal discipline, while the Relational Axis operates more covertly, allowing for subtler manipulation.
