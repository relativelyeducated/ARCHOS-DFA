Data on accidental pregnancies before modern birth control (pre-1960s) is sparse and varies by region, culture, and historical period. Without reliable contraception, unintended pregnancies were common, especially among sexually active women without access to traditional methods like withdrawal, herbal remedies, or abstinence. Estimates suggest 40-60% of pregnancies in pre-modern societies could have been unplanned, based on fertility patterns and limited control over reproduction. 

For a precise figure, we'd need to narrow down a specific time, place, and demographic, as practices and outcomes varied widely. If you want, I can dig deeper into historical data or focus on a particular context—let me know!

Before modern birth control became widely available in the United States, particularly before the introduction of the birth control pill in the 1960s, accidental or unintended pregnancies were a significant issue due to limited contraceptive options. Below is a concise historical overview of accidental pregnancy rates in America before the widespread use of modern birth control, addressing your query about the percentage of accidental pregnancies.

### Historical Context of Birth Control in America
- **Pre-20th Century**: Contraceptive methods were rudimentary, including withdrawal (coitus interruptus), condoms made from animal intestines, and herbal remedies with varying efficacy. Abstinence and prolonged breastfeeding (which can suppress ovulation) were also common. Knowledge of these methods was uneven, often limited by social class, education, and access.
- **19th Century**: The Comstock Laws (1873) criminalized the distribution of contraceptive information and devices, labeling them "obscene." This restricted access to even basic contraception, increasing reliance on less effective methods.
- **Early 20th Century**: Condoms and diaphragms became more available, but access was limited, especially for unmarried women and lower-income groups. The rhythm method (tracking ovulation) gained some popularity but was unreliable due to irregular menstrual cycles.

### Estimates of Accidental Pregnancies
Precise data on accidental pregnancies before the 1960s is scarce because systematic studies were rare, and social stigma often suppressed accurate reporting. However, historical demographic studies and fertility patterns provide some insight:
- **Fertility Rates**: In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the average American woman had 4–7 children, reflecting high fertility rates. Studies suggest that 30–50% of pregnancies may have been unintended, based on analyses of birth spacing and family size preferences (e.g., Guttmacher Institute historical reviews).
- **Unmarried Women**: Unintended pregnancies were particularly high among unmarried women, who lacked access to contraception and faced social pressures. Data from early 20th-century urban studies (e.g., in New York or Chicago) indicate that 50–70% of pregnancies among unmarried women were likely unplanned, often leading to social consequences like forced marriages or illegal abortions.
- **Socioeconomic Factors**: Poorer families, with less access to education or resources, likely experienced higher rates of accidental pregnancies (closer to 50–60%) compared to wealthier families who could afford condoms or private medical advice (perhaps 20–40%).

### Methods and Their Impact
- **Withdrawal**: Widely used but with a high failure rate (up to 20–30% annually with typical use).
- **Condoms**: Available by the late 19th century but expensive and stigmatized, with failure rates of 15–20% due to poor quality.
- **Herbal and Folk Remedies**: Often ineffective, leading to high rates of unintended pregnancies.
- **Illegal Abortion**: A common response to accidental pregnancies, with estimates suggesting 1 in 5 pregnancies ended in abortion by the early 20th century, often under unsafe conditions.

### Turning Point
The approval of the birth control pill in 1960 and the legalization of contraception for unmarried women (Eisenstadt v. Baird, 1972) dramatically reduced unintended pregnancy rates. Before this, the lack of reliable methods meant that accidental pregnancies were a pervasive issue, likely accounting for 40–60% of all pregnancies, with higher rates in marginalized groups.

### Limitations and Notes
- **Data Gaps**: Exact percentages are estimates, as no comprehensive national surveys existed before the mid-20th century. Sources like the Guttmacher Institute and historical demographic studies (e.g., from the U.S. Census or early public health records) provide the best approximations.
- **Cultural Variability**: Rates varied by region, religion, and ethnicity. For example, Catholic communities, which often opposed contraception, may have had higher unintended pregnancy rates due to reliance on the rhythm method.

Did accidental pregnancy in America increase after the available of birth control

The availability of modern birth control, particularly the birth control pill starting in 1960, generally led to a **decrease** in accidental (unintended) pregnancies in the United States over time, rather than an increase. However, the trend is complex and depends on factors like access, usage, demographics, and time period. Below, I’ll outline the historical impact of birth control availability on unintended pregnancy rates in America, addressing your question with available data and reasoning.

### Pre-Birth Control Era (Before 1960)
Before modern birth control:
- Contraceptive options were limited to methods like condoms, diaphragms, withdrawal, and the rhythm method, which had high failure rates (15–30% annually with typical use).
- Estimates suggest 40–60% of pregnancies were unintended, based on historical fertility patterns and family size studies (e.g., Guttmacher Institute). Rates were higher among unmarried women and lower-income groups due to limited access to effective methods.
- High unintended pregnancy rates often led to larger families, illegal abortions (1 in 5 pregnancies pre-1960), or social consequences like forced marriages.

### Post-Birth Control Era (1960s Onward)
The introduction of the birth control pill (1960) and subsequent legalization of contraception for unmarried women (Eisenstadt v. Baird, 1972) transformed reproductive control:
- **Initial Impact (1960s–1970s)**:
  - The pill, with a failure rate of <1% with perfect use, significantly reduced unintended pregnancies among women with access. By the 1970s, over 60% of women of reproductive age used some form of contraception.
  - Studies from the Guttmacher Institute show unintended pregnancy rates began to decline, dropping from an estimated 50–60% in the 1950s to around 40–50% by the late 1970s for all women.
  - However, **temporary increases** in reported unintended pregnancies occurred in some groups due to:
    - **Increased sexual activity**: Greater social acceptance of premarital sex (post-sexual revolution) meant more women were sexually active, increasing the pool at risk of unintended pregnancy if contraception was not used consistently.
    - **Access disparities**: Poor and minority women had less access to the pill or IUDs due to cost, lack of healthcare, or cultural barriers, leading to higher unintended pregnancy rates in these groups (e.g., 60–70% among low-income women in the 1960s).
- **Long-Term Trends (1980s–Present)**:
  - By the 1980s, with wider access to oral contraceptives, IUDs, and other methods, unintended pregnancy rates continued to decline overall. Guttmacher data indicates that by 1994, about 44% of pregnancies were unintended, compared to higher estimates pre-1960.
  - However, rates remained high in specific groups (e.g., teenagers, low-income women), where unintended pregnancies could exceed 50%, often due to inconsistent use or lack of access.
  - Modern data (e.g., 2010s) shows unintended pregnancy rates around 40–45% nationally, a significant reduction from pre-1960 estimates, though still high among disadvantaged groups.

### Did Accidental Pregnancies Increase After Birth Control?
- **Short-Term (1960s–1970s)**: In some demographics, reported unintended pregnancies may have appeared to increase due to:
  - **Behavioral changes**: The sexual revolution increased sexual activity among unmarried women, and not all used contraception consistently. For example, teen pregnancy rates peaked in the 1970s, with unintended pregnancies among teens reaching 60–70% in some studies.
  - **Data visibility**: Better reporting and surveys (e.g., National Survey of Family Growth, started in 1973) made unintended pregnancies more visible, creating a perception of increase.
  - **Access gaps**: While the pill was revolutionary, it wasn’t universally accessible. Rural, poor, and minority women often relied on less effective methods, leading to persistent high unintended pregnancy rates in these groups.
- **Long-Term (Post-1980s)**: The overall trend shows a **decrease** in unintended pregnancies as contraception became more accessible and diverse (e.g., IUDs, implants, patches). For example:
  - Guttmacher data: Unintended pregnancy rates fell from ~59 per 1,000 women (aged 15–44) in 1981 to ~43 per 1,000 by 2011.
  - Teen pregnancy rates dropped dramatically (e.g., from 73 per 1,000 teens in 1990 to 43 per 1,000 by 2013), largely due to increased contraceptive use.

### Why No Overall Increase?
- **Effectiveness of Modern Methods**: The pill, IUDs, and later methods like implants have failure rates of <1–9% with typical use, compared to 15–30% for pre-1960 methods like withdrawal or condoms.
- **Wider Access**: Legalization and public health initiatives (e.g., Title X funding in 1970) expanded access to contraception, especially for low-income women.
- **Education and Awareness**: Increased knowledge about contraception and family planning reduced reliance on ineffective methods.

### Exceptions and Nuances
- **Demographic Disparities**: Unintended pregnancy rates remained high among certain groups (e.g., low-income women, teens, and minorities) even after 1960, often exceeding 50–60%. This was due to inconsistent use, lack of access, or failure to adopt modern methods.
- **Abortion Rates**: Legalization of abortion (Roe v. Wade, 1973) provided an option for unintended pregnancies, which may have reduced the visibility of accidental pregnancies continuing to term but didn’t eliminate them.
- **Cultural Shifts**: Increased sexual activity without corresponding increases in consistent contraceptive use in the 1960s–1970s led to temporary spikes in unintended pregnancies in some groups, but this was not a sustained trend.

### Conclusion
Accidental pregnancies did not increase overall in America after the availability of modern birth control. While temporary spikes occurred in certain groups (e.g., teens, low-income women) in the 1960s–1970s due to social changes and access gaps, the long-term trend shows a decline in unintended pregnancy rates, from an estimated 40–60% pre-1960 to around 40–45% by the 2010s, driven by effective contraception and better access. Disparities persist, however, with higher rates among marginalized groups.
