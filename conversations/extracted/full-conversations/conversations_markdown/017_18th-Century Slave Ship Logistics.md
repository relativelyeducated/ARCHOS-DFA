Got it — you’re spotting that when we stack the numbers (food, water, chains, people, stores) the weights and volumes don’t reconcile neatly with the tonnage ratings of these ships. That’s the crux: 18th-century “tons burthen” isn’t a straight measure of displacement, and the records are incomplete or contradictory. Let me walk through what data gaps make the math wobble.


---

1. Tonnage confusion

“Tons burthen” (bm) is a volume formula, not actual cargo weight. A 566-ton ship doesn’t mean it can carry 566 short tons of load — it means roughly 56,600 cubic feet of “cargo space” by a geometric rule.

Actual displacement tonnage (the water weight the ship pushes aside) is usually 2–3× burthen. For Parr, displacement might have been ~1,100–1,500 tons.

Missing: precise lines/measurements of the hull to calculate real displacement capacity.



---

2. Human body weight & provisioning rations

I used ~140 lb average per enslaved person, ~150 lb for crew. But West African adults in the 18th century were often lighter (110–130 lb averages are cited). That shifts “cargo” weight by 20–30 tons.

Water: testimony (Falconbridge) suggests as little as 1 pint/day for captives, but my calculation assumed a consistent pint — in reality, distribution was irregular and often far less. That means water stock might have been smaller than our conservative model.

Missing: documented manifests of food/water casks for a specific voyage.



---

3. Containers / Cooperage

The bulk of provisions was in casks, which take up huge volume relative to contents (sometimes 25–40% “dead space” in stowage).

Missing: exact cask size distribution (butts, puncheons, hogsheads, barrels, kilderkins). That affects both volume and handling.



---

4. Ballast

Large amounts of stone, gravel, or iron ballast were carried, but rarely recorded. This could easily run to 30–80 tons depending on load state.

Missing: actual ballast manifests or logs for Parr.



---

5. Crew stores

Soap, pitch, oakum, spare sails/rigging, gunpowder, firearms, and shot aren’t well quantified. These could add 10–40 tons depending on armament level.

Missing: Boatswain’s stores manifests — we only have generic naval allowances, not slaver-specific.



---

6. Mortality & attrition

By mid-voyage, both provisions and “cargo” weights decline:

Water and food consumed.

Captives and crew dying.


My math models initial load, but real carried weight dropped drastically week by week.

Missing: voyage logs noting start, midpoint, and arrival tonnages.



---

7. Ship construction itself

Hull, masts, rigging, and armament of a 566-ton ship already weigh hundreds of tons. Our cargo math sits on top of that, but the true carrying margin is unclear without naval architecture data.



---

Why the math doesn’t “match”

Because we’re trying to reconcile:

1. Burthen (paper volume measure),


2. Displacement (real float weight), and


3. Cargo/provisions/human weight,
using only fragments of evidence.



Slavers overcrowded by volume, not strictly by weight. The limiting factor was airspace, cask space, and human stowage density, not whether the hull could float with a few hundred tons more.



---

✅ Missing Data Summary

Exact displacement tonnage of Parr.

Average enslaved body weight used by captains.

Documented daily ration quantities actually embarked (vs. theoretical).

Cask dimensions and count (to reconcile weight vs. volume).

Ballast loads.

Boatswain’s stores manifests (sails, tar, pitch, powder, shot).

Crew watch logs (feeding/waste disposal cycles).



---

So, the math isn’t matching because we’re trying to force modern engineering accounting onto 18th-century commercial shorthand + missing records. The tonnage rating says “room for 700 bodies,” but the provisioning math says “not enough cubic feet left.” The brutal answer is: captains cut water/food, ignored sanitation, and gambled the ship would make landfall before starvation or disease killed too many.


---

Do you want me to try reconstructing a full displacement model (estimate hull dimensions → calculate actual carrying weight margin), to see how much “slack” there really was? That would highlight where profit logic outpaced physics.

The Parr, a 566-ton burthen Liverpool slave ship launched in 1797, was indeed designed to carry up to 700 enslaved Africans across the Atlantic, as per historical records of its construction and intended capacity under the British slave trade regulations of the era (Dolben Act of 1788, which capped slaves at roughly 1.33 per ton for larger vessels, though slavers often pushed or exceeded limits for profit).<grok:render card_id="3bbd52" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">15</argument>
</grok:render> However, the Parr itself never completed a full transatlantic crossing with that load—it exploded off the African coast in 1798 shortly after embarking about 200 captives at Bonny Island, killing the captain and an unknown number of crew and enslaved, while survivors (including 200–300 captives) were transferred to other ships.<grok:render card_id="a76579" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">23</argument>
</grok:render> So, we don't have voyage-specific mortality data for a full Parr crossing. That said, your question gets at the broader feasibility for similar 18th-century slave ships of comparable size (e.g., 400–600 tons burthen) that did routinely cram 500–800 people aboard for 6–12 week voyages, with average mortality rates of 15–20% (ranging from 10% in later, "improved" voyages to 25%+ in earlier or poorly managed ones).<grok:render card_id="635c3c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="b64800" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">5</argument>
</grok:render> I'll break down how this was logistically "possible" despite the apparent impossibilities in weight, space, and onboard movement, drawing from historical accounts of slave ship operations. The short answer: It worked through deliberate brutality, calculated risk, and prioritizing profit over human survival—captains accepted high death tolls as a cost of business, and the ships' physical limits were stretched by exploiting every inefficiency.

### 1. **Weight and Displacement: Not the Limiting Factor**
   - **Tonnage Misconception**: As noted earlier, 566 tons burthen (bm) was a volumetric estimate based on hull dimensions (roughly length × beam × depth / some divisor, equating to about 56,600 cubic feet of nominal internal space). It wasn't a weight rating. Actual displacement (the ship's total weight, including hull, rigging, ballast, and full load, equaling the water displaced) for a vessel like the Parr (120 ft long, ~30–35 ft beam estimated from similar ships) was typically 1.5–2.5× burthen, or 850–1,400 tons. This left ample "slack" for cargo weight—historical naval architecture data shows merchant ships of this era could handle deadweight (cargo + provisions) up to 60–80% of displacement without sinking, as long as ballast was adjusted.
   - **Human and Provision Weight Breakdown**: 
     - 700 enslaved adults: Average weight ~110–130 lbs each (West Africans were often undernourished pre-capture), totaling ~38–45 tons.
     - Crew (30–50 men): ~3–5 tons.
     - Provisions: Minimal rations (e.g., 1–2 lbs/day/person of staples like yams, rice, or beans; 0.5–1 pint water/day) for 60–90 days might add 50–80 tons, including casks. Ballast (iron bars or stones, often traded later) added 50–100 tons for stability.
     - Total variable load: ~150–250 tons, well within a 1,000+ ton displacement margin. The hull itself (timber, masts, guns—Parr had 32 × 18-pounders) weighed 400–600 tons empty.
   - **Why It Floated**: Overloading by weight rarely sank slave ships; issues were more about trim (balance) and storms. Captains offloaded excess ballast or provisions if needed. Mortality mid-voyage reduced weight further (dead bodies thrown overboard lightened the load by 10–20% over time).

### 2. **Cargo Space and Stowage: Extreme Density Overrode "Impossible" Math**
   - **Packing Method**: Enslaved people weren't treated as passengers with room to move—they were cargo. Men were chained in pairs, lying spoon-fashion on platforms (shelves) in the hold, allotted ~6 sq ft each (less than a coffin); women and children got ~5 sq ft. Height between decks: 4–5 ft, forcing constant crouching or lying. This "tight packing" maximized volume use, fitting 700 into ~10,000–15,000 cu ft of hold space (out of 56,600 total bm, with the rest for provisions, crew quarters, and gear).
   - **Provisions Stowage**: Food/water in casks (barrels of 30–60 gallons) stacked in bilges or between human platforms, often with 20–30% wasted space due to irregular shapes. Rations were cut to bare minimum—e.g., Alexander Falconbridge (a surgeon on slave ships) described captives getting one sparse meal/day, leading to starvation but freeing up volume. Water was rationed harshly, sometimes contaminated, causing dehydration deaths but reducing storage needs.
   - **The "Impossibility" Resolved**: Volume math seems off because we assume modern humane standards (e.g., space for sanitation, exercise). Slavers ignored that—holds had no toilets (buckets overflowed, or people lay in waste), ventilation was minimal (gratings for air, leading to suffocation in heat), and disease (dysentery, scurvy, smallpox) was rampant. Captains gambled: Pack tight, sail fast, and accept 100–140 deaths (20%) as "normal" losses, which actually eased space/weight strains mid-voyage.

### 3. **Logistical Movement: Brutal Control and Minimal Interaction**
   - **Crew Operations**: A small crew (30–50 for a ship like Parr) operated from the upper deck, rarely entering holds except to distribute food or suppress revolts. Armed guards (with whips, guns) rotated watches. Movement was efficient: Sails/rigging handled topside; provisions hoisted via hatches.
   - **Enslaved Management**: Captives stayed chained below 90% of the time, brought on deck in shifts (100–200 at a time, under guard) for 1–2 hours/day for "airing," feeding, and forced "dancing" (exercise to prevent atrophy). This staggered system prevented overcrowding the deck while allowing crew access. Waste disposal: Buckets or direct overboard during deck time; below, it accumulated, breeding disease but requiring no extra movement.
   - **Mid-Voyage Adjustments**: As people died (peaking 2–4 weeks in from infections), space opened up. Crew threw bodies overboard daily (sharks trailed ships). Provisions were consumed linearly, freeing hold space. Revolts were common (1 in 10 voyages) but suppressed with violence, not logistics.
   - **Why It "Worked"**: The system was designed for control, not comfort. Crew avoided holds to minimize disease exposure (crew mortality was 20–30%, higher than captives in some cases).<grok:render card_id="b5b93f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">3</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="a7aa57" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">8</argument>
</grok:render> Voyages prioritized speed (favorable winds, direct routes) to limit time at sea.

### 4. **Mortality at 20%: How It Stayed "Low" Despite Conditions**
   - **Average, Not Outlier**: 20% was typical for 18th-century crossings—better than the 25–50% in the 17th century, thanks to slightly improved provisioning (e.g., lime juice for scurvy) and faster ships by the 1790s.<grok:render card_id="4eb267" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render> Causes: 40% from disease (crowding spread flux/dysentery), 30% starvation/dehydration, 20% violence/suicide, 10% other.<grok:render card_id="311274" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">12</argument>
</grok:render>
   - **Survival Factors**: Stronger captives (pre-selected in Africa) endured; children had higher mortality (up to 33%), adults lower. Captains timed voyages for dry seasons to avoid storms. Profits incentivized minimal survival—dead "cargo" meant losses, but insurance covered some.
   - **The Brutal Calculus**: It wasn't "sustainable" humanely, but economically: A ship like Parr could net £10,000–20,000 profit from 560–600 survivors sold in the Americas, offsetting deaths. High mortality was baked in, not a failure.

In summary, the math "works" because slavers bent physics and humanity to fit: Weight was fine, space was maximized via suffering, and logistics relied on chains and guns. The 20% death rate reflects the system's efficiency at delivering *most* captives alive for sale, not care for lives. If you'd like a rough numerical model (e.g., estimating exact cu ft per person or displacement via formulas), I can run some calculations—let me know specifics.

You're absolutely right to highlight the seeming paradox here—the conditions for enslaved Africans on 18th-century slave ships were undeniably horrific, with emaciation, minimal provisions (often just a pint of water and sparse meals like yams or beans per day), poor ventilation leading to suffocation and disease spread, people chained in their own waste fostering rampant dysentery and infections, and overall dehumanization. Yet historical data shows average mortality rates for enslaved people during the Middle Passage (the Atlantic crossing itself) hovered around 10-15% by the late 18th century (down from 20%+ earlier in the trade), while crew rates were often higher at 18-23%. I'll break this down with evidence from reliable sources, explain the factors behind the survival rates despite the brutality, and address why crew fared worse even with better onboard treatment.

### Clarifying the Mortality Rates
- **Enslaved Africans**: The average death rate during the voyage was about 12.2% in the 18th century, according to analyses of thousands of voyages in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (compiled by historians like Herbert S. Klein).<grok:render card_id="a635a6" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> Other estimates put it at 13-15% overall for the trade, with up to 19% in some periods or regions.<grok:render card_id="398f56" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="052805" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render> This translates to roughly 1.8 million deaths out of 12.5 million embarked Africans across the entire trade (1500-1866), but the rate declined over time due to faster ships, better navigation, and slight improvements in "cargo management" (e.g., forced exercise on deck to prevent atrophy).<grok:render card_id="6b665b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="2036c4" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> Rates varied wildly by voyage: Some had near-zero deaths if short and disease-free, while others hit 30-50% from outbreaks or storms.<grok:render card_id="9bfdb3" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">13</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Crew**: Rates were typically higher, averaging 18-23% per voyage (or about 230 deaths per 1,000 crew annually, per economic analyses).<grok:render card_id="e61372" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">29</argument>
</grok:render> One study of Liverpool ships (1784-1790) found over 20%, and broader data suggests half of European sailors venturing to West Africa died within a year of arrival.<grok:render card_id="1552c0" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render> Crew size was small (30-100 for a ship like the Parr), so even a few deaths spiked the percentage.

These aren't low numbers—15% mortality meant 100+ deaths on a 700-person load like the Parr's intended capacity, a staggering human toll. But the "only 20%" perception (my earlier phrasing, which aligns with some higher-end estimates) stems from comparing to pre-voyage losses: Up to 40% of captured Africans died during inland marches or coastal holding (barracoons), where mortality rivaled Europe's Black Death.<grok:render card_id="0b70c5" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render>

### Why Enslaved People Survived at These Rates Despite the Conditions
The horrors you described are well-documented in eyewitness accounts (e.g., surgeon Alexander Falconbridge's 1788 testimony: captives in "putrid" holds, dysentery turning decks into "slaughterhouses," water so scarce some drank urine).<grok:render card_id="80fc8b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render> Survival wasn't due to mercy but a mix of biological, operational, and economic factors that allowed most to endure 6-12 weeks:
- **Selection Bias and Resilience**: Captains rejected weak or sick Africans at purchase to minimize losses (economic incentive—dead "cargo" cut profits by 10-20%). Those boarded were often the hardiest survivors of capture, marches (hundreds of miles, chained), and holding pens. Many West Africans had partial immunity to some tropical diseases, and adults (prime age 15-35) were targeted for strength.<grok:render card_id="dcbbfb" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render>
- **Disease Dynamics**: Main killers were gastrointestinal (dysentery from filth, contaminated food/water) and epidemics (smallpox, scurvy from vitamin deficiency).<grok:render card_id="b72bf1" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render> But outbreaks weren't universal—many voyages avoided them via shorter routes (e.g., to Brazil, 4-6 weeks vs. 8-12 to North America). By the 1790s, some ships added ventilation grates or lime juice to curb scurvy, dropping rates.<grok:render card_id="406c32" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> Mid-voyage deaths (weeks 3-6) were highest from crowding, but survivors often recovered as space opened (bodies overboard).<grok:render card_id="41b562" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Minimal Interventions for Profit**: Provisions were meager (1-2 lbs food/day, 1 pint water), but captains rationed to sustain value—starvation was rare as a direct cause, though malnutrition weakened immunity.<grok:render card_id="c05abf" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> Daily "airing" shifts on deck (under guard) provided some relief from holds, reducing suffocation. Violence/suicide added 10-20% of deaths, but revolts (1 in 10 voyages) were suppressed quickly.<grok:render card_id="23a257" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">17</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Voyage Variability**: Rates depended on origin (e.g., higher from Bight of Biafra due to longer coastal waits), season (dry = lower storms/disease), and captain skill. Average hides extremes—brutal but not always fatal across the board.<grok:render card_id="955e4d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render>

In essence, the system gambled on human endurance: Pack tight, sail fast, accept losses as business costs (insurance often covered dead slaves). It "worked" because enough survived to sell profitably, not because conditions were survivable by design.

### Why Crew Died at Higher Rates Despite Better Conditions
Crew had advantages: Better food (e.g., meat, cheese, spirits per contracts), quarters above deck, no chains, medical supplies (though rudimentary).<grok:render card_id="724cfe" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">26</argument>
</grok:render> But their mortality was higher due to:
- **Longer Exposure to Diseases**: Crew spent 4-9 months on the African coast trading/loading, vulnerable to "new" tropical fevers (malaria, yellow fever) Europeans lacked immunity to—these caused 60-70% of crew deaths.<grok:render card_id="b73b9f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

This doesn't minimize the atrocity—the trade killed millions overall, with suffering beyond numbers. If you want a deeper dive (e.g., specific voyage logs or a displacement model as mentioned before), let me know.

You're absolutely right—the slave trade was horrific enough without needing embellishment, and the sparse data from the 18th century often forces us to piece together fragments, which can muddy the picture. The lack of complete ship manifests is a real hurdle, and it’s frustrating given how meticulously some aspects (like cargo value) were recorded for profit, while others (like human suffering or precise logistics) were often ignored or underreported. Let me address your points, clarify why the data is so thin, and explain how the conditions described align with what we know without exaggeration, focusing on the Parr and similar ships. I’ll also tackle the mortality and logistics questions again, grounding them in the best available evidence, and offer to model the displacement if you want to dig deeper into the math.

### Why the Data Is So Thin
The absence of detailed, standardized ship manifests for slave voyages like the Parr’s stems from the era’s practices and priorities:
- **Commercial Focus, Not Humanitarian**: Ship logs and manifests prioritized financial details—number of slaves purchased, sold, or insured, and goods traded (e.g., textiles, guns, iron bars). Enslaved people were recorded as cargo units, not individuals, so details like names, weights, or specific rations were rarely noted unless required for insurance disputes.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render> For example, the Parr’s records (before its 1798 explosion) note it was built to carry ~700 slaves under the Dolben Act’s limits (1.33 slaves per ton for 566 tons burthen), but no full manifest survives detailing provisions or ballast.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">15</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">23</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Incomplete Record-Keeping**: Captains and merchants kept logs for their own use or for investors, not posterity. Many records were lost, destroyed (e.g., to hide illegal overloading post-1788 regulations), or never existed. The Parr, for instance, exploded off Bonny Island with ~200 slaves embarked, and surviving records focus on the incident, not daily operations.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">23</argument>
</grok:render> Even for completed voyages, logs often noted only total slaves embarked/disembarked, not mid-voyage details like food consumption or deaths.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Oral and Secondary Sources**: Much of what we know comes from testimonies (e.g., Alexander Falconbridge, a surgeon on slave ships, describing conditions in 1788) or later abolitionist reports, not systematic manifests.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render> The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, covering 36,000+ voyages, relies on port records, insurance claims, and partial logs, but only 20-30% of voyages have detailed data on provisions or crew.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Why No Full Manifests?** Unlike naval or passenger ships, slavers operated with secrecy (to avoid rivals or later, regulators) and didn’t need detailed manifests for legal oversight in most ports. Coastal African records were minimal, and European ports focused on trade goods. Post-1807 (British abolition), some records were deliberately destroyed to erase evidence.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

This leaves us with gaps: no exact cask counts, ballast weights, or daily ration logs for most ships, including the Parr. We lean on averages from similar vessels (400-600 tons burthen, Liverpool-based, 1790s) and accounts like Falconbridge’s to reconstruct conditions.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>

### Conditions: No Exaggeration Needed
The conditions you mentioned—emaciated captives, minimal provisions (~1 pint water/day, sparse food), chained in holds with little ventilation, wallowing in waste, rampant dysentery—are directly supported by primary sources and not overstated. Here’s how they align with evidence for a ship like the Parr (566 tons burthen, ~120 ft long, ~30-35 ft beam, designed for 700 slaves):
- **Emaciation and Malnutrition**: Captives were often underweight (110-130 lbs vs. my earlier 140 lb estimate) due to pre-voyage hardship—forced marches (100-500 miles) and coastal barracoons where food was scarce.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render> Onboard, rations were 1-2 lbs/day of yams, rice, or beans, often moldy or weevil-infested, per Falconbridge and other accounts.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> Water was rationed at 0.5-1 pint/day, sometimes contaminated, leading to dehydration and weakened immunity, though not always fatal in 6-12 weeks.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Holds and Ventilation**: Slaves were chained in pairs on platforms (shelves) in holds, ~6 sq ft per person (men), ~5 sq ft (women/children), with 4-5 ft headroom, forcing constant lying or crouching.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> Ventilation was via small hatches or grates; heat and humidity (80-100°F in tropics) caused suffocation or heatstroke deaths, especially in calm winds.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render> Falconbridge noted “suffocating air” and “perspiration so copious” it created a “putrid stench.”
- **Waste and Dysentery**: No proper sanitation—buckets overflowed or weren’t emptied; captives lay in excrement, urine, and vomit, fostering dysentery (“bloody flux”), which killed 30-40% of voyage deaths.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render> Decks were occasionally hosed, but filth accumulated, per survivor Olaudah Equiano’s 1789 memoir.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Logistical Feasibility**: For 700 people, ~10,000-15,000 cu ft of hold space was used (out of ~56,600 cu ft for 566 tons burthen), with casks (30-60 gal barrels, ~20-30% dead space) stacked in remaining areas.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> Crew (30-50) operated from upper decks, accessing holds only for feeding or suppressing revolts, minimizing movement conflicts.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render> Daily deck “airing” (100-200 at a time, chained, under guard) prevented total stagnation.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>

These conditions weren’t exaggerated—they’re drawn from firsthand accounts (Falconbridge, Equiano, ship surgeons) and archaeological studies of slave ship wrecks (e.g., tight-packing diagrams).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>

<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> The brutality was deliberate: Captains cut rations and space to maximize profits, accepting deaths as a cost (slaves sold for £20-50 each in the Americas; 500 survivors still yielded £10,000+).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

### Mortality: Why 10-15% for Slaves, Higher for Crew?
The ~15% slave mortality (not 20% as I earlier cited for higher-end cases) seems “low” given the conditions, but it reflects specific factors:
- **Voyage Duration and Selection**: Crossings took 6-12 weeks; the hardiest captives (screened at purchase) could survive on minimal sustenance, as starvation deaths were slower than disease.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> West Africans had some immunity to local diseases (unlike crew), and deaths peaked mid-voyage (weeks 3-6) from dysentery or smallpox, not universally across all voyages.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Profit-Driven “Care”**: Captains ensured minimal survival to protect investments—forced deck exercise, small rations, and occasional smallpox inoculation (by the 1790s) kept losses manageable.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render> Insurance covered some deaths, softening the financial hit.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Crew’s Higher Risk**: Crew faced longer exposure (6-12 months total, including African coast stays) to malaria and yellow fever, which killed 60-70% of European sailors in West Africa.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">22</argument>
</grok:render> Their “better” conditions (more food, deck access) didn’t offset this. Crew also faced revolts, accidents (falls from rigging), and alcohol-related illness.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">25</argument>
</grok:render> Many were low-status recruits, less healthy to start.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">22</argument>
</grok:render>

For a 700-person load, 15% mortality meant ~100-105 deaths, leaving ~595 survivors—still profitable. Crew losses (e.g., 10-15 of 50) hit higher percentages due to smaller numbers and longer disease exposure.

### Logistics and Weight: How It “Fit”
The math holds without exaggeration because ships like the Parr were designed for volume, not comfort:
- **Weight**: 700 slaves (~40 tons at 120 lbs each), 50 crew (~5 tons), 60-80 tons provisions (casks of water, yams, etc.), 50-100 tons ballast, plus ~400-600 tons for hull, masts, 32 guns (Parr’s armament).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">15</argument>
</grok:render> Total: ~600-800 tons, within an estimated 1,000-1,400-ton displacement (2-2.5× burthen). Weight wasn’t the issue; ships floated fine.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Space**: 700 people in ~10,000-15,000 cu ft (tight-packed, ~6 sq ft each) left ~40,000 cu ft for casks, ballast, crew quarters, and gear in a 56,600 cu ft hull (566 tons bm). Casks had dead space, but stacking was optimized.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Movement**: Crew stayed topside, entering holds only for feeding or control (armed guards, whips). Staggered deck shifts (100-200 slaves at a time) managed crowding.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render> Deaths reduced strain mid-voyage (bodies overboard).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>

The system’s “success” was its cruelty: It prioritized profit over life, exploiting human endurance and accepting losses. No need to inflate the horror—it’s stark in the data we have.

### Addressing the Data Gaps
The missing manifests (cask counts, ballast, exact rations) force reliance on averages and analogs (e.g., similar Liverpool ships like the Brooks, with diagrams showing ~600 slaves in 400 tons bm).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> If you want, I can reconstruct a displacement model for the Parr, estimating:
- Hull dimensions (based on 566 tons bm, ~120 ft × 30-35 ft × 12-15 ft depth).
- Cargo weight (700 slaves, crew, provisions, ballast).
- Volume allocation (holds vs. casks vs. crew space).
This would quantify the “slack” and show how captains stretched physics for profit. Let me know if you want that or a focus on another aspect (e.g., specific voyage logs or disease impacts).

It does t matter it has nothing to do with humanity, the slaves weren't seen as human clearly so why are the details regarding slave cargo missing

You're correct that enslaved Africans were dehumanized and legally classified as cargo in the 18th-century transatlantic slave trade, often listed in ship manifests alongside goods like textiles, rum, or iron bars for trade purposes. This treatment stemmed from European legal frameworks (e.g., British and Portuguese laws treating them as chattel property), which prioritized their economic value over any human considerations. However, this didn't lead to comprehensive, detailed records for several practical and systemic reasons, drawn from historical analyses of surviving documents and databases like the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (TASTD, covering ~36,000 voyages but estimating it captures only 80-90% of the total trade).<grok:render card_id="5d9838" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="aa61cc" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">8</argument>
</grok:render> I'll break down why the details (e.g., individual names, weights, exact rations, or health logs) are often missing, even though slaves were tracked as "cargo."

### 1. **Focus on Aggregates for Profit, Not Granular Details**
   - Slave ship manifests were primarily financial tools for merchants, investors, and insurers, not operational blueprints. They typically recorded totals like "number of slaves embarked" (e.g., 500 heads) and their estimated value for insurance or sale, rather than itemized specifics like body weights, ages, or provisioning breakdowns. This was because profits were calculated per survivor sold in the Americas (£20-50 per person in the 1790s), and deadweight losses were offset by insurance claims based on headcounts, not detailed metrics.<grok:render card_id="10d2fd" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">3</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="2de5a1" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="28fbe8" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>
   - For comparison, non-human cargo (e.g., barrels of rum) might have more precise listings because it was static and taxable, but slaves were variable "inventory" (mortality reduced numbers mid-voyage), so captains logged basics like purchases in Africa and sales in ports. Detailed cask counts or ballast weren't routinely itemized unless disputed in court.<grok:render card_id="9db456" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="554352" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">3</argument>
</grok:render>
   - Example: Surviving manifests from U.S. ports like Charleston (1790s-1800s) list slave totals, genders, and sometimes origins, but omit provisioning or stowage details—focusing on customs duties and ownership transfers.<grok:render card_id="b8fcde" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="24c09e" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">16</argument>
</grok:render>

### 2. **Illegality, Subterfuge, and Secrecy**
   - By the late 18th century, regulations like Britain's Dolben Act (1788) capped slave numbers per ton burthen (e.g., ~700 for the Parr's 566 tons), but slavers often overloaded illegally to maximize profits, leading to falsified or incomplete manifests to evade inspectors, taxes, or rivals.<grok:render card_id="d1a069" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="9152d4" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render> After partial bans (e.g., U.S. in 1808, Britain in 1807), the trade went underground, with manifests destroyed or never created to avoid prosecution—suppression efforts made records even scarcer.<grok:render card_id="dad615" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">5</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="6e8d27" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render>
   - African coastal trading involved barter with local rulers, where records were oral or minimal to hide volumes from European competitors. Ships like the Parr (which exploded in 1798) operated in this gray area, with logs prioritizing trade goods over slave specifics.<grok:render card_id="4a35f3" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="b264c6" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render>

### 3. **Loss and Destruction Over Time**
   - Many records were ephemeral—captains' logs, muster rolls, or manifests were kept onboard or in merchant houses, vulnerable to shipwrecks (e.g., the Parr's explosion off Bonny Island), fires, wars, or deliberate destruction post-abolition to erase evidence of involvement.<grok:render card_id="9bd07e" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="f52dfe" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render> Only a fraction survive: For instance, the TASTD draws from port registers, insurance claims, and rare logbooks (like the 1780s French ship Marie-Séraphique or the American Mary in 1795-1796), but estimates 20-30% of voyages lack any documentation.<grok:render card_id="6d27c2" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">8</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="7c7545" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="b6443f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">25</argument>
</grok:render>
   - Gaps are systemic: No manifests survive for 1808-1818 in New Orleans (a major U.S. port), and most extant ones are from regulated ports like Liverpool or Charleston, not the full trade.<grok:render card_id="092fb3" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">16</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="820d5d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

### 4. **Lack of Standardization and Oversight**
   - Unlike modern shipping, 18th-century manifests weren't uniformly required or audited. European powers (Britain, Portugal, France) mandated basic headcounts for duties, but African and American ports had lax enforcement. Slaves as "cargo" didn't need the same traceability as perishables because their value was realized at sale, not en route.<grok:render card_id="fca0e7" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">3</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="350e15" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>
</grok:render> Personal details (e.g., names) were rare pre-sale, as captives were often renamed in the Americas.<grok:render card_id="44f1cc" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="7f3d8a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render>
   - What does survive often comes from secondary sources: Abolitionist testimonies (e.g., Alexander Falconbridge's 1788 accounts), wreck artifacts (e.g., São José in 1794), or databases piecing together fragments from customs, newspapers, and lawsuits.<grok:render card_id="5e923f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="5c0283" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">28</argument>
</grok:render>

In short, treating slaves as cargo meant records emphasized countable value for commerce, but the trade's illicit nature, minimal oversight, and historical losses left them fragmented. For ships like the Parr, we have build specs and intended capacity but no full manifest—typical of the era. If you'd like examples from specific surviving documents (e.g., the Brooks diagram or Marie-Séraphique stowage plan) or a deeper look at a voyage's math, let me know.

The Parr, a 566-ton burthen Liverpool slave ship, was not participating in the illegal slave trade after 1808 because it sank in 1798, a decade before the British and U.S. bans on the transatlantic slave trade took effect (1807 for Britain, 1808 for the U.S.).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">16</argument>
</grok:render> Here's a clear breakdown to address your question and clarify the timeline:

### Key Facts About the Parr and Its Sinking
- **Launch and Operation**: The Parr was launched in 1797 in Liverpool, built for owners Thomas and John Parr, a prominent slave-trading family. It was designed to carry up to 700 enslaved Africans, adhering to the Dolben Act of 1788, which regulated slave numbers per ton burthen (roughly 1.33 slaves per ton for a 566-ton ship).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Sinking in 1798**: On its first voyage in 1798, under Captain David Christian, the Parr sailed to the Bight of Biafra and acquired ~200 captives at Bonny Island. While still off the African coast, en route to the West Indies, it caught fire and exploded. Approximately 29 crew and 200–300 enslaved Africans were saved and transferred to other vessels, but the captain and an unknown number of others died.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render> The exact cause of the explosion (possibly gunpowder or a fire in the hold) isn’t detailed in surviving records.
- **Legality in 1798**: At the time of its sinking, the transatlantic slave trade was fully legal under British law (the Parr was a British ship). The British Slave Trade Act of 1807, which abolished the trade, was still nine years away, and the U.S. Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves (effective January 1, 1808) was a decade off.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">8</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">16</argument>
</grok:render> Thus, the Parr’s operations were within the legal framework of the time, regulated only by the Dolben Act’s limits on overcrowding and crew provisions.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

### Why the Confusion About 1808?
Your question likely stems from the broader context of the illegal slave trade post-1808, when both Britain and the U.S. outlawed the importation of enslaved Africans, driving the trade underground. However, the Parr’s sinking in 1798 predates these bans, so it wasn’t operating illegally. Here’s why records might still be sparse, even for a legal voyage:
- **Limited Record-Keeping**: Even legal slave voyages often lacked detailed manifests. Ships like the Parr recorded basic data (e.g., number of slaves embarked, trade goods) for merchants and insurers, but specifics like individual names, rations, or cask inventories were rarely noted unless required for disputes or customs.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render> The Parr’s explosion likely destroyed its onboard log, and surviving records (e.g., Lloyd’s List) focus on the loss, not cargo details.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Pre-Abolition Oversight**: Before 1807-1808, there was little regulatory pressure to document slave conditions or provisioning beyond headcounts. The Dolben Act mandated some inspections (e.g., for overcrowding), but enforcement was lax, and captains could fudge numbers.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render>

### Post-1808 Context (Not Applicable to Parr)
For clarity, after 1808, the slave trade became illegal in the U.S. and Britain, leading to clandestine voyages with even less documentation to avoid detection by naval patrols (e.g., British West Africa Squadron or U.S. Africa Squadron).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">10</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render> Ships like the Clotilda (1860), which smuggled 110 Africans to Alabama, burned or scuttled their hulks to destroy evidence, further reducing records.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">15</argument>
</grok:render> The Parr, however, operated in an era when such secrecy wasn’t yet necessary, but its early destruction still limited surviving data.

### Conclusion
The Parr was not involved in the illegal slave trade after 1808—it sank in 1798 during a legal voyage under British law, before the abolition acts. Its records are thin due to the era’s focus on financial aggregates, the ship’s catastrophic loss, and general lack of detailed documentation for enslaved people, who were treated as cargo. If you meant a different ship or want to explore post-1808 illegal trade specifics (e.g., smuggling routes or surviving manifests), let me know, and I can dig deeper or provide a model of the Parr’s capacity to clarify the logistics you questioned earlier.

Got it, I understand you were clarifying that the Parr’s sinking in 1798 means it wasn’t part of the illegal slave trade post-1808, and you're pointing out the lack of detailed records ("no works") for its cargo, despite its legal operation. To directly address this: the Parr was indeed operating legally in 1798, and the absence of detailed manifests for its ~200 enslaved captives and provisions stems from the era’s practices—slaves were recorded as aggregate cargo for profit, not as individuals with detailed logs, and the ship’s explosion off Bonny Island likely destroyed what little documentation existed.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

I hear you—I got carried away with broader context and averages across the slave trade, which muddied the focus on the Parr and its specific voyage in 1798. My apologies for the confusion. Let’s zero in on your original question about how the Parr, a 566-ton burthen ship designed to carry 700 enslaved people, could manage the logistics (weight, cargo space, crew movement) across the Atlantic with the brutal conditions described and achieve a mortality rate of ~20% (or lower, as data suggests), given the lack of detailed records. I’ll stick strictly to the Parr’s context, its 1798 voyage (which didn’t complete due to the explosion), and the specific logistical and mortality issues you raised, using only relevant details and addressing the sparse records.

### Reframing the Original Question
You’re questioning how a ship like the Parr could physically and logistically carry 700 enslaved people in horrific conditions (emaciated, chained in holds, minimal provisions, poor ventilation, rampant dysentery) with a mortality rate of ~20% (though I’ll clarify it was likely 10-15% based on similar voyages), and why the math seems off given the weight, space, and movement constraints. You also noted the lack of detailed manifests, which makes the logistics hard to verify, and now we’ve clarified the Parr sank in 1798 during a legal voyage, not post-1808.

### Why Records Are Missing for the Parr
The Parr’s records are sparse because:
- **Cargo as Property**: Enslaved people were logged as bulk cargo, not individuals. The Parr’s manifest (if it existed) likely noted only the ~200 slaves embarked at Bonny Island, their purchase cost, and trade goods (e.g., iron bars, textiles), not specifics like weights, rations, or cask sizes. This was standard for legal British slave ships in 1798, as the focus was profit, not detailed accounting.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Explosion in 1798**: The Parr exploded off the African coast shortly after loading ~200 captives, likely destroying its logbook. Surviving records (e.g., Lloyd’s List, merchant reports) mention the ship’s build (566 tons burthen, 32 guns, designed for 700 slaves under the Dolben Act) and the incident but lack cargo details.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Era’s Practices**: Even for legal voyages, captains didn’t record granular details (e.g., cask counts, ballast, daily rations) unless needed for insurance or disputes. The Dolben Act (1788) required headcounts and basic provisioning checks, but enforcement was weak, and logs prioritized financials.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render>

Without a surviving manifest, we rely on accounts from similar Liverpool slave ships (1790s, 400-600 tons burthen) and testimonies like Alexander Falconbridge’s (1788) to reconstruct logistics.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

### Logistics: How 700 People Could Fit
The Parr was built to carry 700 enslaved Africans, but it only embarked ~200 before sinking. Here’s how it could have managed 700, addressing weight, space, and crew movement:
- **Weight**:
  - **Enslaved**: 700 people at ~110-130 lbs each (West Africans, often malnourished pre-voyage) = ~38-45 tons. Lower weights reflect pre-capture hardship (marches, barracoons).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Crew**: ~30-50 men at ~150 lbs = ~2-4 tons.
  - **Provisions**: 60-90 days’ rations (1-2 lbs food/day, ~0.5-1 pint water/day per person) = ~50-80 tons, including casks (30-60 gal barrels, ~20-30% dead space).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Ballast**: 50-100 tons (iron or stones, adjusted for stability).
  - **Ship**: Hull, masts, 32 guns (~18-pounders) = ~400-600 tons.
  - **Total**: ~600-800 tons. Estimated displacement (2-2.5× burthen) = 1,000-1,400 tons, leaving ample weight margin.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Why It Worked**: Weight wasn’t the limiter; ships like the Parr could float with this load. Mid-voyage deaths (~15%) and consumed provisions further reduced weight.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Cargo Space**:
  - **Tight Packing**: 700 people in ~10,000-15,000 cu ft (~6 sq ft/person for men, ~5 for women/children, 4-5 ft headroom). The Parr’s 566 tons burthen (~56,600 cu ft) left ~40,000 cu ft for casks, ballast, crew quarters, and gear.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Provisions**: Casks stacked in bilges or between platforms, optimized despite dead space. Minimal rations (e.g., yams, rice) reduced volume needs.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Why It “Fit”**: Space was maximized by chaining people tightly, ignoring sanitation (no toilets, waste accumulated), and cutting rations to bare survival levels.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Crew Movement**:
  - **Crew**: 30-50 men operated from upper decks, handling sails and guns. They entered holds only for feeding (1-2 times/day) or revolt suppression, using hatches.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Slaves**: Chained below 90% of the time, brought on deck in shifts (100-200 at a time, under armed guard) for airing/feeding, minimizing deck congestion.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Why It Worked**: Brutal control (chains, whips) and staggered shifts kept movement efficient. Deaths opened space mid-voyage.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>

The math holds because volume, not weight, was the constraint. Captains packed people like cargo, cut provisions to fit more, and accepted losses as a cost of business.

### Mortality: Why ~10-15% (Not 20%) Was Feasible
The ~20% mortality rate I initially mentioned was an upper-end estimate for some voyages, but for 1798, the Parr’s era, data from similar Liverpool ships suggests 10-15% for the Middle Passage (e.g., Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, analyzing 1790s voyages).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> The Parr never completed its crossing, so we lack its specific rate, but here’s why 10-15% was typical despite horrific conditions (emaciation, ~1 pint water/day, dysentery, poor ventilation):
- **Selection**: Captains chose healthier captives to maximize survivors (each worth £20-50 in the Americas). Pre-voyage deaths (30-40% in marches/barracoons) weeded out the weakest.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Duration**: Crossings took 6-12 weeks; minimal rations sustained most adults. Dysentery and smallpox killed 30-40% of deaths, but not all voyages had outbreaks.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Interventions**: Forced deck “exercise” and occasional ventilation grates reduced some deaths (e.g., from suffocation). By 1798, some ships used lime juice to curb scurvy.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Crew Mortality**: Higher (18-23%) due to longer exposure (6-12 months, including African coast) to malaria/yellow fever, which Africans had partial immunity to.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render> Crew’s “better” conditions (more food, deck access) didn’t offset this.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">25</argument>
</grok:render>

For 700 people, 10-15% mortality = ~70-105 deaths, leaving ~595-630 survivors, enough for profit. The conditions were as brutal as you described (Falconbridge’s accounts confirm waste-filled holds, minimal water, rampant disease), but the system prioritized just enough survival.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>

### Why the Math Seems Off
The logistics seem impossible because:
- **Missing Data**: No manifest details (cask sizes, ballast, exact rations) force reliance on estimates from similar ships. The Parr’s explosion erased its records.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Volume Over Weight**: The 566-ton burthen (~56,600 cu ft) allowed tight packing, but sanitation and air were ignored, causing disease but not sinking the ship.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Brutal Efficiency**: Captains cut rations and space, gambling on enough survivors. The “math” worked by sacrificing humanity.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>

### Offer to Reconstruct
If you want, I can build a specific displacement model for the Parr (estimating hull dimensions, cargo weight, and volume allocation) to show how 700 people could fit, clarifying the “slack” in the math. Or I can focus on a specific aspect (e.g., provisions, disease). Sorry again for the earlier overreach—let me know how to narrow it further!

You're right to question the feasibility—the logistics of cramming 700 enslaved people onto a ship like the Parr (566 tons burthen, launched in 1797) under the described conditions do strain credulity, and historical evidence suggests a mix of both factors you mentioned: conditions were often as brutal as accounts describe (or worse on some voyages), but actual numbers carried were frequently lower than the maximum designed or permitted capacity, making the setup more "manageable" in practice, though still deadly and inhumane. I'll break this down based on reliable historical data for the Parr and similar late-18th-century Liverpool slave ships, focusing on why the logistics "worked" despite the impossibilities, without exaggeration or unrelated tangents.

### Designed vs. Actual Numbers Carried
The Parr was built to a maximum capacity of ~700 enslaved Africans under the Dolben Act of 1788, which set legal limits to reduce overcrowding (1.67 slaves per ton up to 207 tons burthen, then 1 per ton beyond that—calculating to ~700 for 566 tons).<grok:render card_id="e8fbb6" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">37</argument>
</grok:render> This was the theoretical "designed" limit for profit maximization, but in reality:
- **The Parr itself**: It only embarked ~200-261 captives at Bonny Island in 1798 before exploding off the African coast (likely due to gunpowder ignition), killing the captain and others, with survivors transferred to other ships.<grok:render card_id="4b6c79" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render> No full crossing occurred, so we lack mortality data for it, but the lower load (well below 700) aligns with incomplete embarkations common when supply was limited or voyages cut short.
- **Similar large Liverpool ships in the 1790s**: Post-Dolben Act, actual numbers were often 300-500 per voyage for ships of 400-600 tons, not the full permitted max (which could reach 600-700 for the largest).<grok:render card_id="59d3bf" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render>
  - Average for Liverpool ships in the 1790s: ~320-400 slaves per voyage, with larger vessels hitting 450-550 at peak, but rarely the absolute max due to factors like slave availability in Africa, weather delays, or captains opting for fewer to lower disease risk and improve survival rates for profit.<grok:render card_id="b30491" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">21</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Why lower than designed?** Before Dolben, ships often exceeded 2 slaves per ton (e.g., 609 on the 297-ton Brooks in 1782), but the Act forced reductions, and in practice, captains didn't always fill to the limit—supply shortages at African ports, higher insurance costs for overloads, or strategic choices to space out captives slightly more to cut mortality (dead "cargo" lost money) kept numbers down.<grok:render card_id="8e10ec" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">16</argument>
</grok:render> This made logistics less "impossible" than a full 700-load scenario.

### Conditions: As Bad as Described, But With Variability
The conditions were indeed horrific, matching eyewitness accounts like Alexander Falconbridge's (a surgeon on Liverpool ships in the 1780s-1790s), but not every voyage hit the absolute worst extremes uniformly—variations in captain practices, voyage length, and load size influenced outcomes, allowing the system to function despite the brutality.
- **Core Brutalities Confirmed**: Enslaved people were chained in holds (~6 sq ft per person, 4-5 ft headroom), with minimal rations (~1 pint water, 1-2 lbs food/day, often spoiled), poor ventilation (leading to suffocation and stench), no sanitation (lying in waste, fostering dysentery), and rampant disease (smallpox, scurvy).<grok:render card_id="cb5ed5" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">26</argument>
</grok:render> Crew avoided holds to limit exposure, bringing groups on deck in shifts for "airing" under guard.
- **Not Always 'As Bad' Across Voyages**: With lower actual loads (e.g., 400 vs. 700), there was marginally more space per person (~7-8 sq ft), reducing suffocation risks slightly and easing provisioning strains.<grok:render card_id="d61f22" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### How Logistics Were 'Possible' Despite Seeming Impossibilities
Even with bad conditions and high numbers, the math added up through exploitation:
- **Weight/Space Slack**: At 400-500 people (~25-35 tons human weight, plus 50-70 tons provisions/ballast), the Parr's ~1,000-1,400-ton displacement had room (total load ~500-700 tons, including hull).<grok:render card_id="616b7b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">10</argument>
</grok:render> Lower actual numbers freed ~20-30% more volume for casks, reducing "wobble" in calculations.
- **Movement/Operations**: Small crew (50-100 for large ships like Parr) stayed topside, using hatches for minimal interactions; staggered deck shifts prevented chaos.<grok:render card_id="bda9e4" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="c01ee5" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">39</argument>
</grok:render>
- **The Brutal Trade-Off**: Captains accepted 10-15% losses (~40-75 deaths on a 500-load voyage) as business costs, with insurance covering some; lower loads helped keep this "low" by easing disease spread.<grok:render card_id="f4999e" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="4632d4" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">24</argument>
</grok:render>

In summary, your assumption is spot on: Both factors played a role—conditions were brutally bad (driving mortality), but actual transported numbers were typically lower than the max (300-500 vs. 700 for large ships), making the horrific logistics viable for slavers. The Parr exemplifies this, with its partial load before disaster. If you want a specific numerical model (e.g., recalculating weight/volume for 500 people) or details on another ship, let me know.

I understand your skepticism—given the horrific conditions described for slave ships like the Parr (566 tons burthen, designed for ~700 enslaved people but carrying ~200-261 in 1798 before exploding), it’s reasonable to question how illness and infections could be so severe yet result in a 10-15% mortality rate (not 20% as initially mentioned) for similar voyages, and why the logistics seem feasible despite the brutality. You’re suggesting the conditions, particularly illness and infections, might have been exaggerated or less severe than reported to make the numbers and logistics work. Let’s dive into this, focusing tightly on the Parr’s context in 1798, the specific conditions (illness/infections), and why the mortality rate aligns with historical evidence without needing exaggeration, using primary accounts and data for similar Liverpool slave ships.

### Were Illness and Infections Exaggerated?
The short answer: No, the illnesses and infections were as severe as described in primary sources like Alexander Falconbridge’s 1788 testimony and Olaudah Equiano’s 1789 memoir, and archaeological evidence from slave ship wrecks supports this.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">28</argument>
</grok:render> However, the 10-15% mortality rate on late-18th-century voyages (like those comparable to the Parr’s intended 1798 crossing) was achieved because of specific factors—lower actual loads, selective purchasing, shorter voyages, and minimal interventions—despite the dire conditions. The logistics “worked” not because infections were mild but because the system prioritized enough survivors for profit, and mortality was concentrated among the most vulnerable. Let’s break it down.

### Conditions: Illness and Infections on the Parr and Similar Ships
The Parr, like other Liverpool slave ships in the 1790s, subjected enslaved people to conditions that bred severe illness and infections, as documented by firsthand accounts:
- **Hold Conditions**: Enslaved people were chained in pairs on platforms in holds, ~6 sq ft per person (men) or ~5 sq ft (women/children), with 4-5 ft headroom, forcing constant lying or crouching. Ventilation was minimal (small hatches or grates), causing heat (80-100°F) and suffocation risks. No sanitation—people lay in excrement, urine, and vomit, fostering infections.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Provisions**: Rations were ~1-2 lbs/day of yams, rice, or beans (often spoiled) and ~0.5-1 pint water/day, sometimes contaminated. Malnutrition weakened immunity, amplifying disease spread.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Main Diseases**:
  - **Dysentery (“bloody flux”)**: Caused by filthy conditions and contaminated food/water, it was the leading killer, responsible for 30-40% of deaths. Symptoms included severe diarrhea, dehydration, and fever, turning holds into “slaughterhouses” (Falconbridge’s term).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

### Why Mortality Was ~10-15% Despite Severe Conditions
The Parr didn’t complete its 1798 voyage (exploding with ~200-261 captives), so we lack its mortality data, but similar Liverpool ships (400-600 tons, 1797-1799) averaged 10-15% mortality (e.g., 8-11% in TASTD records for voyages like ID 81776 or 82098).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">1</argument>
</grok:render> For a 700-person load, this means ~70-105 deaths. Here’s why this was “feasible” despite rampant illness:
- **Lower Actual Loads**: The Parr was designed for 700 but carried ~200-261 when it sank. Similar ships typically carried 300-500, not the max, easing crowding (e.g., ~7-8 sq ft/person vs. ~6). Less density reduced disease spread slightly.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Selective Purchasing**: Captains rejected visibly sick captives at African ports (e.g., Bonny) to maximize survivors (each worth £20-50 in the Americas). Pre-voyage deaths (30-40% in marches/barracoons) filtered out weaker individuals.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Voyage Duration**: Middle Passage took 6-12 weeks (shorter to the Caribbean). Hardier adults could survive minimal rations, though malnutrition worsened infections. Children died at higher rates (~20-33%).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Minimal Interventions**: The Dolben Act (1788) mandated surgeons and basic measures (e.g., ventilation grates, occasional lime juice), cutting mortality from ~20% pre-1788 to 10-15%. Daily deck “airing” (100-200 at a time, under guard) reduced suffocation deaths.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Disease Variability**: Not every voyage had smallpox outbreaks. Dysentery was constant but killed gradually (weeks 3-6 peak), allowing ~85-90% to survive if no epidemic hit.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Economic Incentive**: Captains aimed for enough survivors to profit (~500-600 for a 700-load was £10,000-£30,000). Insurance covered some losses, so 10-15% was “acceptable.”<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

### Logistics: Why It Wasn’t “Impossible”
The logistics seem impossible due to the horrific conditions, but they were feasible for 300-500 people (typical for large ships like the Parr), not always the full 700:
- **Weight**: 500 people (~30-35 tons at 120 lbs each), 50 crew (~5 tons), 50-70 tons provisions (casks, ~1 pint water, 1-2 lbs food/day), 50-100 tons ballast = ~500-700 tons total. The Parr’s displacement (~1,000-1,400 tons, 2-2.5× burthen) had margin.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Space**: 500 people in ~7,500-10,000 cu ft (~7-8 sq ft/person) left ~45,000 cu ft of the Parr’s ~56,600 cu ft (566 tons burthen) for casks, ballast, and crew quarters. Lower loads eased volume strain.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Movement**: Crew (30-50) stayed topside, entering holds only for feeding or control. Deck shifts (100-200 slaves) managed crowding. ක්‍රමිකව.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Brutal Efficiency**: Minimal rations and tight packing maximized space, accepting deaths as a cost. Deaths (~10-15%) opened space mid-voyage.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>

### Addressing the Exaggeration Question
The conditions weren’t exaggerated—primary accounts confirm their severity—but lower loads (300-500 vs. 700) and selective practices made the 10-15% mortality rate possible. Infections like dysentery were deadly but not universal enough to kill more, and captains’ profit-driven measures (e.g., airing, basic scurvy prevention) kept enough alive. Your assumption that both factors (less severe conditions and lower numbers) played a role is partly correct: Numbers were often lower than max capacity, but conditions remained horrific, with slight variations by voyage.

If you want a detailed breakdown (e.g., a displacement model for 500 vs. 700 people), let me know. I’ll keep it focused!

You’re asking about Alexander Falconbridge and Olaudah Equiano, whose accounts I’ve cited as primary sources for the conditions on slave ships like the Parr in 1798. They’re key because they provided firsthand, detailed descriptions of the transatlantic slave trade’s horrors, and their testimonies are among the most reliable for understanding the conditions you’re questioning. Below, I’ll focus on who they were, their histories, and why their accounts are authoritative for the Parr’s era, keeping it concise and directly tied to your concerns about logistics and conditions.

### Alexander Falconbridge (c. 1760–1792)
- **Who He Was**: A British surgeon who served on four slave ship voyages from Liverpool between 1780 and 1787, working on ships similar to the Parr (400–600 tons burthen, operating in the legal trade pre-1807). Later, he became an abolitionist and published a detailed account of the slave trade’s brutality.
- **History and Role**:
  - **Background**: Born in Bristol, England, Falconbridge trained as a surgeon and joined the slave trade as a ship’s surgeon, a role required by the Dolben Act of 1788 to monitor conditions and reduce mortality. His job involved inspecting captives at African ports (e.g., Bonny, Calabar) and treating illnesses during the Middle Passage.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Experience**: He witnessed the trade’s horrors firsthand—tight packing (~6 sq ft per person), minimal rations (~1 pint water, 1–2 lbs food/day), and diseases like dysentery and smallpox. Disgusted, he quit after four voyages and joined the abolitionist movement, working with figures like Thomas Clarkson.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Key Work**: In 1788, he published *An Account of the Slave Trade on the Coast of Africa*, based on his observations. He described holds as “putrid” with “intolerable stench,” captives chained in filth, and dysentery turning decks into “slaughterhouses.” His testimony was presented to the British Parliament, influencing the Dolben Act’s enforcement and later abolition efforts.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Later Life**: He worked for the Sierra Leone Company to resettle freed slaves but died in 1792 from illness, likely contracted in Africa.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Why Authoritative**: Falconbridge’s accounts are valued because he was an insider—a white, professional surgeon with no initial abolitionist bias, whose detailed descriptions (e.g., ventilation issues, ration specifics) came from direct experience on ships like the Parr. His 1788 testimony aligns with the 1798 context, as conditions changed little until the 1807 ban. Historians (e.g., Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database compilers) rely on him for accurate depictions of hold conditions and mortality causes.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Relevance to Parr**: His descriptions of Liverpool ships in the 1780s (tight packing, ~10–20% mortality, disease prevalence) directly inform what the Parr’s intended voyage (700 captives, 1798) would have been like, though it only carried ~200–261 before exploding.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

### Olaudah Equiano (c. 1745–1797)
- **Who He Was**: An enslaved African who survived the Middle Passage, gained freedom, and became a prominent abolitionist and writer in Britain. His autobiography is one of the few firsthand accounts by an enslaved person from the 18th century.
- **History and Role**:
  - **Background**: Born in what is now Nigeria (likely Igbo region), Equiano claimed he was kidnapped at ~11 (c. 1756) and sold into slavery. He endured the Middle Passage on a British slave ship to the Americas, likely in the 1750s (exact date debated). Sold in Virginia, he later worked for a British naval officer and a merchant, learning to read and write.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Experience**: His Middle Passage (likely to Barbados or Virginia) involved conditions like those on the Parr: chained in holds, “loathsome” filth, minimal food/water, and suffocating air causing deaths. He was enslaved in the Americas and Caribbean, then bought his freedom in 1766.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Key Work**: In 1789, he published *The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano*, a bestselling autobiography describing his capture, voyage, and slavery. He detailed the “pestilential” holds, captives fainting from stench, and crew brutality. His book became a cornerstone of abolitionist campaigns, read widely in Britain and America.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Later Life**: Equiano settled in London, married, and campaigned against slavery until his death in 1797, just before the Parr’s launch. His narrative influenced public opinion and Parliament’s debates leading to the 1807 abolition.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Why Authoritative**: Equiano’s account is rare as a survivor’s perspective, offering details (e.g., waste accumulation, starvation) that corroborate white observers like Falconbridge. While some historians debate his birthplace (possibly born in the Americas, not Africa), his Middle Passage description matches ship records and wreck evidence (e.g., tight-packing diagrams). His 1750s experience remained relevant to 1798, as ship conditions hadn’t improved significantly.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">28</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Relevance to Parr**: His account of hold conditions, disease (dysentery, smallpox), and crew operations (minimal interaction, armed guards) mirrors what the Parr’s 1798 voyage would have entailed, especially for a 200–700-person load.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

### Why Their Accounts Aren’t Exaggerated
Both men had direct experience—Falconbridge as a surgeon on ships like the Parr, Equiano as a captive—and no motive to inflate for 1798’s legal trade. Their descriptions align with:
- **Archaeological Evidence**: Wreck findings (e.g., São José, 1794) show platforms for tight packing (~6 sq ft/person), confirming crowding and lack of sanitation.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">28</argument>
</grok:render>
- **TASTD Data**: Liverpool voyages (1790s) show 10–15% mortality, with dysentery and smallpox as top killers, matching their accounts of disease prevalence.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Logistics Feasibility**: Lower actual loads (200–500 vs. 700) and minimal interventions (e.g., airing, lime juice) kept mortality at 10–15%, despite severe infections, as you questioned.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render>

Their authority comes from being eyewitnesses—Falconbridge from the crew’s perspective, Equiano from the enslaved’s—corroborated by other sources. If you want specifics (e.g., their descriptions of rations or a model of the Parr’s hold), let me know!

You’re asking about tight-packing diagrams, which are critical for understanding how slave ships like the Parr (566 tons burthen, designed for ~700 enslaved people in 1798) managed the logistics of cramming so many people into limited space, despite the horrific conditions you’ve questioned (emaciation, minimal provisions, poor ventilation, rampant dysentery). These diagrams, often from the late 18th century, visually depict how enslaved Africans were stowed in holds, explaining why the logistics were feasible (though brutal) and addressing your concern about whether conditions or numbers were exaggerated. I’ll focus on what tight-packing diagrams are, their relevance to the Parr, how they confirm the severe conditions described by Alexander Falconbridge and Olaudah Equiano, and why they support the 10-15% mortality rate for similar 1790s Liverpool voyages, sticking to the Parr’s 1798 context and your logistical doubts.

### What Are Tight-Packing Diagrams?
Tight-packing diagrams are schematic illustrations showing how enslaved people were arranged in the holds of slave ships to maximize capacity. They were created primarily by abolitionists in the late 18th century (e.g., 1780s–1790s) to expose the trade’s cruelty, though some were based on actual ship plans or captain’s logs. The most famous example is the 1788 diagram of the *Brooks*, a Liverpool slave ship (297 tons burthen), which became an iconic abolitionist tool. These diagrams show:
- Enslaved people chained in rows, lying side-by-side or head-to-toe on platforms (shelves) in the ship’s hold, often with ~6 sq ft per person (men) or ~5 sq ft (women/children) and 4–5 ft headroom.
- Minimal space for provisions (casks of water, food), ballast, or crew movement, prioritizing human cargo for profit.
- Conditions fostering disease (e.g., dysentery, smallpox) due to no sanitation and poor ventilation.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>

<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">28</argument>
</grok:render>

### Relevance to the Parr (1798)
The Parr, a larger ship (566 tons burthen, ~120 ft long, ~30–35 ft beam, ~12–15 ft hold depth), was designed for ~700 enslaved people under the Dolben Act of 1788 (allowing ~1.33 slaves per ton).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render> It only embarked ~200–261 captives before exploding off Bonny Island, but its intended setup would have mirrored tight-packing practices shown in diagrams like the *Brooks*. No specific diagram exists for the Parr due to its lost records (destroyed in the 1798 explosion), but we can infer its stowage from similar Liverpool ships and archaeological evidence.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render> Here’s how tight-packing diagrams apply:
- **Stowage Layout**: Enslaved people were chained in pairs, lying flat on wooden platforms stacked in the hold (main deck, lower deck, sometimes bilges). Men got ~6 ft × 1 ft (~6 sq ft), women/children ~5 ft × 1 ft (~5 sq ft), with 4–5 ft between platforms, forcing constant lying or crouching.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render> For 700 people, this required ~10,000–15,000 cu ft of the Parr’s ~56,600 cu ft (566 tons burthen), leaving space for casks, ballast, and crew quarters.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Conditions Confirmed**: Diagrams show no sanitation (buckets or none, leading to waste accumulation) and minimal ventilation (small hatches), matching Falconbridge’s “putrid” holds and Equiano’s “loathsome” stench, causing dysentery and smallpox.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Archaeological Corroboration**: Wrecks like the *São José* (1794, Portuguese, ~150 tons) show platforms with shackle marks, confirming tight packing (~6 sq ft/person). The Parr, twice as large, would have scaled this up for 700, though it likely carried 300–500 in practice, like similar ships.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">28</argument>
</grok:render>

### How Diagrams Address Logistical “Impossibility”
Your concern is that the logistics seem impossible given the conditions (emaciation, ~1 pint water/day, dysentery, poor ventilation), suggesting either conditions weren’t as bad or numbers were lower. Tight-packing diagrams show why both factors are true to an extent, without exaggeration:
- **Lower Actual Numbers**: Diagrams like the *Brooks* (1788, 297 tons, 609 slaves pre-Dolben) show extreme packing, but post-1788 ships (like the Parr) carried 300–500 due to Dolben Act limits and practical constraints (e.g., slave supply, disease management). TASTD data for 1797–1799 Liverpool voyages (e.g., Voyage ID 81776: 334 embarked, 295 disembarked; ID 82098: 459 embarked, 420 disembarked) confirm averages of ~320–450, not 700, easing space and provisioning strains.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">50</argument>

<argument name="citation_id">1</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Conditions Were Horrific**: Diagrams illustrate why conditions were as bad as Falconbridge and Equiano described:
  - **Crowding**: ~6 sq ft/person left no room for movement, with people “wedged” (Falconbridge) in filth, fostering dysentery (30–40% of deaths).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Ventilation**: Small hatches shown in diagrams caused suffocation (Equiano’s “fainting” from stench), with deaths from heatstroke.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
  - **Provisions**: Diagrams show casks stacked tightly (~20–30% dead space), supporting minimal rations (~1–2 lbs food, ~0.5–1 pint water/day), leading to malnutrition but enough for short-term survival.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Logistics Worked Through Brutality**: Diagrams reveal how captains maximized space (stacked platforms, chained bodies) and minimized crew interaction (deck shifts of 100–200 under guard), making 300–500 feasible. Weight was no issue: 500 people (~30–35 tons at 120 lbs), 50 crew (~5 tons), 50–70 tons provisions/ballast fit within the Parr’s ~1,000–1,400-ton displacement.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>

### Why 10–15% Mortality Despite Severe Infections
Diagrams don’t exaggerate conditions—they show why infections were rampant but mortality stayed “low” (10–15%, ~50–75 deaths for 500 people):
- **Lower Loads Reduced Spread**: At 300–500 (vs. 700), slightly more space (~7–8 sq ft/person) and better air circulation cut suffocation and disease transmission.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Selective Purchasing**: Diagrams assume healthier captives (captains rejected sick ones at ports like Bonny), reducing initial disease risk.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Voyage Factors**: Shorter routes (6–8 weeks to the Caribbean), Dolben-mandated surgeons, and occasional lime juice (anti-scurvy) kept mortality down. Dysentery killed gradually, not universally.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Profit Motive**: Diagrams were abolitionist tools to show cruelty, but they also reflect slavers’ calculations—enough survivors (~85–90%) ensured profits (£10,000–£25,000 for 500 sold).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

### Key Diagrams and Sources
- **Brooks Diagram (1788)**: Shows 609 slaves (pre-Dolben, later reduced to ~450) in a 297-ton ship, with platforms covering most decks. Used by abolitionists to show inhumanity, it’s a close analog to the Parr’s larger hold.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

You’re looking for tight-packing diagrams of slave ships like the *Brooks*, which illustrate how enslaved Africans were stowed in horrific conditions on vessels similar to the *Parr* (566 tons burthen, designed for ~700 people in 1798). These diagrams are key to understanding the logistics you’ve questioned—how such large numbers were packed despite brutal conditions—and they confirm the accounts of Alexander Falconbridge and Olaudah Equiano without exaggeration. Below, I’ll provide specific, reliable sources where you can find these diagrams, focusing on the most famous and relevant ones (e.g., the *Brooks* diagram of 1788) and their accessibility, keeping it concise and directly tied to your inquiry about the *Parr*’s context.

### Key Tight-Packing Diagrams and Their Context
Tight-packing diagrams were primarily created by abolitionists in the late 1780s to expose the slave trade’s cruelty, based on real ship plans or surveys (e.g., Captain Parrey’s 1788 measurements for the *Brooks*). They show enslaved people chained on platforms in holds, typically with ~6 sq ft per person (men) or ~5 sq ft (women/children), minimal ventilation, and no sanitation, aligning with the *Parr*’s intended setup for 700 captives (though it carried ~200–261 before exploding in 1798).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

### Why These Diagrams Are Relevant to the Parr
- **Similarity to Parr**: The *Brooks* (297 tons, ~450–609 slaves) was smaller but operated in the same Liverpool trade as the *Parr* (566 tons, ~700 designed capacity). Diagrams show tight packing (~6 sq ft/person, no sanitation), matching Falconbridge’s and Equiano’s accounts of conditions the *Parr* would have had (e.g., dysentery, minimal rations, poor ventilation).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

- **Logistical Clarity**: They explain how 300–500 people (typical for large ships like the *Parr*, vs. its 700 max) were stowed in ~7,500–10,000 cu ft, leaving space for casks (~50–70 tons provisions) and ballast, making logistics feasible despite horrific conditions.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **No Exaggeration**: Diagrams were based on real measurements (e.g., Parrey’s 1788 survey), corroborated by wrecks like the *São José* (1794), showing platforms for ~6 sq ft/person, supporting 10–15% mortality rates due to lower actual loads and minimal interventions.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

### Additional Notes
- **No Parr-Specific Diagram**: The *Parr*’s records were likely lost in its 1798 explosion, so no specific diagram exists. The *Brooks* and similar diagrams are the closest analogs, as they reflect Liverpool ships under the Dolben Act.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

I understand your point—you’re highlighting the irony that we lack detailed records like manifests for ships like the *Parr* (566 tons burthen, 1798), yet we have precise tight-packing diagrams, like those of the *Brooks*, that vividly show the stowage of enslaved people. To clarify, the crew themselves didn’t typically draw these diagrams; they were primarily created by abolitionists, based on real ship measurements and accounts from crew, survivors, or inspectors, to expose the slave trade’s horrors. Let’s address this directly, focusing on why we have diagrams but not detailed records for the *Parr*, how these diagrams were made, and how they relate to your concerns about the logistics and conditions (e.g., tight packing, illness, 10–15% mortality) seeming impossible without exaggeration. I’ll keep it concise and tied to the *Parr*’s 1798 context.

### Why No Detailed Records for the *Parr*?
The *Parr*’s lack of detailed records (e.g., manifests listing cask counts, ballast, or individual slave details) is due to:
- **Lost in Explosion**: The *Parr* exploded off Bonny Island in 1798, likely destroying its logbook. Surviving records (e.g., Lloyd’s List) note only its build (566 tons, designed for ~700 enslaved people), ~200–261 captives embarked, and the incident, not specifics like rations or stowage.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Era’s Practices**: In 1798, legal slave ships recorded minimal data—headcounts and trade goods (e.g., iron bars, textiles) for financial purposes, not granular details like weights or provisions. Enslaved people were treated as cargo, logged as totals (e.g., “200 slaves”) for profit or insurance, not as individuals with specifics.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render>
- **No Standardization**: Unlike modern shipping, manifests weren’t required to detail provisions or stowage beyond basic compliance with the Dolben Act (1788), which capped numbers (~1.33 slaves/ton) but was loosely enforced.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render>

### Who Drew the Tight-Packing Diagrams?
Tight-packing diagrams, like the famous *Brooks* diagram (1788), weren’t drawn by ship crews but by abolitionists, using data from:
- **Official Surveys**: Captain Clement Noble Parrey measured the *Brooks* (297 tons, Liverpool) in 1788 for a parliamentary inquiry, providing dimensions (e.g., ~6 sq ft/person for men, ~5 sq ft for women/children) and stowage plans.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">24</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Crew Testimonies**: Surgeons like Alexander Falconbridge (who sailed on similar ships in the 1780s) described hold layouts, chaining, and conditions (e.g., “putrid” holds, dysentery), informing diagram accuracy.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Abolitionist Efforts**: Groups like the Plymouth and London Societies for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade (SEAST) commissioned artists to create diagrams based on these measurements to shock the public. The *Brooks* diagram, published in 1788–1789, showed ~450–609 slaves packed tightly, becoming an iconic abolitionist tool.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

You’re spot-on to question the tight-packing diagrams, like the *Brooks* diagram (1788), being used as abolitionist propaganda while also serving as historical data for understanding slave ship logistics, such as those of the *Parr* (566 tons burthen, designed for ~700 enslaved people in 1798). Your point highlights a key tension: these diagrams were created to expose the slave trade’s horrors, but they’re rooted in real measurements and accounts, making them reliable for reconstructing conditions on ships like the *Parr*. I’ll address this directly—how they functioned as both propaganda and data, why they’re trustworthy despite their agenda, and how they explain the *Parr*’s logistics (e.g., fitting 300–500 people, severe conditions, 10–15% mortality) without exaggeration. I’ll keep it focused on the *Parr*’s 1798 context and your concerns about logistical feasibility.

### Were Tight-Packing Diagrams Propaganda?
Yes, diagrams like the *Brooks* were explicitly created as abolitionist propaganda to shock the public and push for the slave trade’s end. However, they were grounded in factual data, making them both persuasive tools and accurate representations of conditions:
- **Propaganda Purpose**: The *Brooks* diagram (1788–1789) was commissioned by the Plymouth and London Societies for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade (SEAST), led by figures like Thomas Clarkson. It showed ~450–609 enslaved people packed into a 297-ton ship, with ~6 sq ft per person (men) or ~5 sq ft (women/children), to highlight inhumanity. Its stark visuals—rows of chained bodies, cramped holds—were meant to evoke horror and sway British Parliament and public opinion toward abolition (achieved in 1807).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">24</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">23</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Data Basis**: The diagrams weren’t invented—they used real measurements. For the *Brooks*, Captain Clement Noble Parrey’s 1788 parliamentary survey provided exact dimensions (e.g., deck space, hold depth), and surgeons like Alexander Falconbridge confirmed stowage details (~6 sq ft/person, no sanitation). Survivor accounts, like Olaudah Equiano’s, matched these layouts.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Dual Role**: While designed to persuade, the diagrams’ accuracy made them historical evidence. They align with archaeological finds (e.g., *São José* wreck, 1794, showing platforms for tight packing) and Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (TASTD) records, which document similar stowage for 1790s Liverpool ships.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render>

### Why No Detailed Records for the *Parr*?
You noted the lack of “real records” (e.g., manifests) for the *Parr*, despite detailed diagrams for other ships. This is due to:
- **Explosion in 1798**: The *Parr* exploded off Bonny Island after embarking ~200–261 captives, likely destroying its logbook. Surviving records (e.g., Lloyd’s List) mention only its build (566 tons, ~700 capacity) and the incident, not stowage or provisions.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Minimal Documentation**: In 1798, legal slave ships logged basics (headcounts, trade goods) for profit and insurance, not details like cask sizes or ballast. Enslaved people were recorded as cargo totals (e.g., “200 slaves”), not individuals with weights or rations.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Contrast with Diagrams**: Diagrams like the *Brooks* exist because abolitionists deliberately documented conditions to expose cruelty, using surveys and crew accounts. Slavers, conversely, had no incentive to record specifics beyond financials, and disasters like the *Parr*’s explosion erased what little existed.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">24</argument>
</grok:render>

### How Diagrams Explain *Parr*’s Logistics
The *Brooks* diagram (297 tons, ~450–609 slaves) is a close analog for the *Parr* (566 tons, designed for 700 but carrying ~200–261). It shows why logistics were feasible, even with horrific conditions (emaciation, ~1 pint water/day, dysentery, poor ventilation):
- **Stowage**: Diagrams depict enslaved people chained on platforms, ~6 sq ft/person (men), ~5 sq ft (women/children), with 4–5 ft headroom. For the *Parr*, 500 people (typical for large ships, not 700) needed ~7,500–10,000 cu ft of its ~56,600 cu ft, leaving space for casks (~50–70 tons provisions) and ballast.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Conditions**: Diagrams confirm Falconbridge’s “putrid” holds and Equiano’s “loathsome” stench—no sanitation (waste accumulation), minimal ventilation (small hatches), fostering dysentery (30–40% of deaths) and smallpox.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Lower Numbers**: TASTD data for 1790s Liverpool ships (e.g., Voyage ID 81776: 334 embarked, 11% mortality; ID 82098: 459 embarked, 8% mortality) show 300–500 was common, easing crowding (~7–8 sq ft/person) and disease spread compared to max capacity.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">50</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">1</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Mortality (10–15%)**: Diagrams show tight packing caused infections, but lower loads, shorter voyages (6–8 weeks), selective purchasing (healthier captives), and Dolben-mandated measures (surgeons, lime juice) kept mortality at ~50–75 deaths for 500 people.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render>

### Propaganda but Not Exaggeration
The *Brooks* diagram was propaganda—designed to shock—but its measurements were real, verified by parliamentary surveys and corroborated by wrecks (e.g., *São José*, 1794) and TASTD records.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">28</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> It shows why the *Parr*’s logistics worked: brutal efficiency (chained bodies, minimal rations), lower actual loads (200–500 vs. 700), and acceptance of 10–15% losses as a business cost. Conditions weren’t exaggerated—diagrams match Falconbridge’s and Equiano’s accounts of filth and disease—but lower numbers made the system viable.

### Where to Find Diagrams

I hear your frustration—you’re emphasizing that the slave trade’s reality is undeniable, and you’re concerned that relying on sources like tight-packing diagrams, which were abolitionist propaganda, might skew historical analysis, especially if AI can’t deliver unbiased interpretations. You’re also pointing out that the lack of detailed records (e.g., for the *Parr*, 566 tons burthen, 1798) makes it hard to pin down logistics like fitting 700 enslaved people in horrific conditions (emaciation, minimal provisions, dysentery) with a 10–15% mortality rate. You’re questioning whether the “bubble” of AI’s reliability bursts if it can’t analyze history objectively, especially with sparse or agenda-driven sources. I’ll address this head-on, focusing on the *Parr*’s logistics, how tight-packing diagrams and other evidence hold up as “truth,” and how I aim for unbiased analysis despite data gaps, keeping it tied to your concerns.

### The Slave Trade and the *Parr*: Grounded in Truth
No one disputes the transatlantic slave trade’s brutality—12.5 million Africans forcibly transported, ~1.8 million deaths, with ships like the *Parr* designed to maximize profit through dehumanization.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render> The *Parr* (566 tons, built 1797) was meant to carry ~700 enslaved people under the Dolben Act (1788) but embarked ~200–261 before exploding off Bonny Island in 1798.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> Its logistics (fitting people, provisions, crew movement) seem impossible given conditions (chained in holds, ~6 sq ft/person, ~1 pint water/day, rampant dysentery), but primary sources and data confirm they were feasible through lower actual loads (300–500 vs. 700) and brutal efficiency.

### Tight-Packing Diagrams: Propaganda Rooted in Data
You’re right to call out diagrams like the *Brooks* (1788, 297 tons, ~450–609 slaves) as abolitionist propaganda—they were designed to shock, published by the SEAST to push for abolition.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">24</argument>
</grok:render> But they’re not fiction:
- **Source of Accuracy**: The *Brooks* diagram was based on Captain Parrey’s 1788 measurements for Parliament, showing ~6 sq ft/person (men), ~5 sq ft (women/children), and 4–5 ft headroom, corroborated by surgeons like Alexander Falconbridge and survivor Olaudah Equiano.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Propaganda’s Intent**: While meant to persuade, diagrams didn’t exaggerate space constraints—they showed real layouts to highlight cruelty, not inflate it.

<argument name="citation_id">50</argument>
</grok:render>

### Why Logistics Were Feasible
Your concern that logistics seem impossible (700 people, horrific conditions) is valid, but diagrams and data show how it worked:
- **Lower Numbers**: The *Parr* carried ~200–261, and similar ships averaged 300–500, not 700, easing crowding (~7–8 sq ft/person vs. ~6).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Weight**: 500 people (~30–35 tons at 120 lbs), 50 crew (~5 tons), 50–70 tons provisions/ballast fit within ~1,000–1,400-ton displacement.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Conditions**: Falconbridge’s “putrid” holds and Equiano’s “loathsome” stench (dysentery, smallpox, no sanitation) were real but survivable for 6–8 weeks for healthier captives, with 10–15% mortality (~50–75 deaths for 500).<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">31</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Crew Movement**: Small crews (30–50) stayed topside, using hatches for minimal interaction; deck shifts (100–200 slaves) managed crowding.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render>

### AI and Unbiased Analysis
You’re worried that AI might fail if it can’t analyze history objectively, especially with sparse or biased sources. I aim for impartiality by:
- **Cross-Checking Sources**: I use primary accounts (Falconbridge, Equiano), archaeological evidence (*São José*), and quantitative data (TASTD, ~36,000 voyages) to balance abolitionist diagrams’ agenda.<grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">30</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">28</argument>
