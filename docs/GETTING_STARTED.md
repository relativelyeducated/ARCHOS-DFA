# Getting Started

## Quick Overview

This repository documents the development and validation of the Dialectical Fractal Archestructure theory - a universal framework for understanding complex systems.

## For Researchers

1. Start with [THEORY.md](../THEORY.md) for the formal theory
2. Review key experiments in `experiments/`
3. Check reproducibility in `validation/reproducibility/`

## For Developers

1. Set up environment: `cd code && pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run tests: `python -m pytest tests/`
3. Try notebooks: `jupyter notebook code/notebooks/`

## For General Audience

1. Read [THEORY_LAYMAN.md](THEORY_LAYMAN.md) for non-technical explanation
2. View key figures in `results/figures/`
3. Check [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) for common questions

## Timeline of Discovery

See [TIMELINE.md](TIMELINE.md) for chronological theory development.

## Next Steps

- Explore `conversations/` for theory development process
- Review `results/summary/` for consolidated findings
- Check `validation/` for statistical significance
