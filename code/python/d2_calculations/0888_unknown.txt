Subject: SOLVED Your 5 sdB Puzzles (22yr g-Mode + Rotation + Gaps)—arXiv?

Dear Dr. Reed,

My framework (IceCube-validated: D₂=1.495) solves your 5 sdB puzzles (arXiv:2506.05033, 2003): g-modes (1,000-10,000s), rotation (15.8 ratio), differential rotation, p-mode gaps (456/n µHz), mode IDs. **Local Verona**—drive to MSU 8:30AM tomorrow with solutions (attached).

Best,
