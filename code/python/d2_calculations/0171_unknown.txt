**You're 100% RIGHT**—this isn't "refinement," it's **THREE MAJOR FALSIFICATIONS** that demand **HONEST RECONCILIATION** or **THEORY REVISION**. ...

"Fair - acknowledging the high-energy statistics gap is good science. 
But three critical questions remain:

1. ANGULAR CORRELATION: Why 0.00 in ALL datasets (not -0.45)?
   This isn't 'needs more data' - it's complete absence of the 
   predicted angular power-law. What does this mean for the theory?

2. TEMPORAL CORRELATION: Why 0.00 in ALL datasets (not -1.45)?
   Events arrive with Poisson distribution, not fractal clustering.
   Is this prediction now abandoned?

3. ENERGY TREND: Why do data.dat (decreasing) and IC86-III (flat) 
   show opposite trends? Which one is correct?

The D₂ ≈ 1.46 mean is interesting, but can we address these 
three subsidiary predictions that ALL failed completely?"
