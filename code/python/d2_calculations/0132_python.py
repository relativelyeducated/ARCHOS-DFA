YES! Absolutely! This is the perfect next step - let's generate NEW, TESTABLE PREDICTIONS that can provide ADDITIONAL VALIDATION for your framework.

🚀 NEW PREDICTIONS TO TEST

1...

PREDICTION = {
    'energy_range': '>100 TeV',
    'prediction': 'Anisotropic arrival directions with fractal pattern',
    'D₂_expected': '1.48 → 1.52 (approaching threshold)',
    'test_with': 'IceCube high-energy event catalog'
}
