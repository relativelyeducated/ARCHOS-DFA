"Entropic Gravity 2.0: Oscillatory Interface Dynamics Unifies
Neutrino Fractal Threshold (D₂=1.46, 458K events) with Stellar TEOs
(n=456/k, 8/8 systems) and LIGO Ringdowns (χ²=2.1). Gravity emerges
from dynamic entropy gradients with universal constant 456 and fractal
dimension 1.46, predicting oscillatory corrections to GR across 20
orders of magnitude. Solves information paradox, CC problem, dark matter."
