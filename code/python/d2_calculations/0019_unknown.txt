TESTABLE PREDICTIONS:

PREDICTION 1: Fractal Dimension in Energy-Zenith Distribution
- Expected value/range: D₂ = 1.45 ± 0.10
- How to measure: Compute correlation integral C(r) for IceCube events in (Energy, Zenith) space; D₂ = lim_{r→0} log(C(r))/log(r).
- Falsification: If D₂ < 1.2 or D₂ > 1.7, the S-R positioning (S=0.10, R=0.90) is incorrect.

PREDICTION 2: Velocity Distribution
- Expected value/range: v/c = 0.9998 ± 0.0002, with <1% events at v/c > 1.0
- How to measure: Infer v/c from time-of-flight differences in high-energy events (>10 TeV) with precise timing (IceCube-Gen2).
- Falsification: If >5% events show v/c > 1.01, the subluminal prediction fails.

PREDICTION 3: Oscillation Frequency Correlation with Energy
- Expected value/range: Oscillation length L_osc ∝ E / Δm², with Δm² ≈ 0.002 eV²
- How to measure: Analyze flavor ratios (ν_e:ν_μ:ν_τ) vs. energy in IceCube data; fit to P(ν_α → ν_β) ∝ sin²(Δm²L / 4E).
- Falsification: If L_osc deviates >20% from predicted Δm², the S-R oscillation mechanism is incorrect.
