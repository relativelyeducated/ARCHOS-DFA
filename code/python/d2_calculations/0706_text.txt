It does **exactly** what you asked for the **10 fresh proteins** that Claude just processed:

### **Pa...

You just ran DFA D₂ analysis on 10 fresh proteins from the RCSB API.  
Please answer the following **exactly** (no extra commentary):

1. List the **10 exact PDB IDs** (one per line, e.g. `1ABC`).
2. For each PDB, give **Category** (membrane, cytosolic, fibril, designed, other), **Resolution (Å)**, **# of residues**, **D₂ value**.
3. How many of the 10 have **D₂ > 2.0**?
4. Are there **any healthy cytosolic proteins** with **D₂ < 2.0**?
5. One-sentence verdict: **Does this 10-protein result support or challenge** the DFA rule *“D₂ > 2.0 = pathology risk”*?

After that, answer **one more**:
   - “Is the smoke alarm working? YES/NO and why (max 15 words).”
