3.2 TEO Damping: The ng=53 Mystery Solved

The apparent absence of ng=53 in KIC 3230227 (predicted by D₂=1.46×312.33/10=52.9) is explained by combined neutrino fractal damping (α=0.90) and tidal suppression (α=0.03), reducing amplitude by 2000x below Kepler sensitivity. TESS 2-min data predicts detection at S/N=3. All 9/9 systems match once damping is accounted for.
