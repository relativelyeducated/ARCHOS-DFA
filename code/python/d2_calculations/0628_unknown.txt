## DFA Core Principle: Arch vs Catenary

### The Fundamental Distinction

**CATENARY (Dead/Physics):**
- Hangs under gravity
- Settles into minimum energy
- Fol...

Physics (Catenary):
- S >> R
- System settles
- D₂ → stable value
- Clean measurements

Biology (Arch):
- R resists S
- System actively maintains tension
- D₂ = D₂_base + f(anti_entropic_work)
- Variance = signal, not noise

Pathology:
- Arch → Catenary transition
- R-axis work fails
- System collapses toward equilibrium
- Cancer/prions/aging = losing arch tension
