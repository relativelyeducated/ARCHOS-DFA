### D₂ Unifies DFA ToE
Initial runs of 5O3L PHF (~2.4) and 2MXU amyloid-β (~1.25) via updated scripts aim to validate protein stability vs. collapse, aligning with IceCube’s coupled (>1.49) and collapse (~1.46) zones. Hybrid metrics, for civilizational scales, will follow, unifying neutrino, TEO (456/k), and protein dynamics (Babel-like).
