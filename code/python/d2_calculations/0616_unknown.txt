## The Critical Realization

**D₂ ≈ 1.5 might be the S-R INTERFACE optimal**, but...

**Pure R-axis dynamics might have entirely di...

R-axis metric might not be D₂ at all, but:

∇·R = divergence of relational field
  Positive divergence = information source (active sites?)
  Negative divergence = information sink (binding pockets?)
  Zero divergence = flow-through regions

|∇R| = gradient magnitude (how steep the relational landscape)

∇×R = curl (cyclical/oscillatory dynamics)
