Subject: Solved Your 2023 Subdwarf B Period Mystery—arXiv Sponsorship?

Dear Dr. Reed,

Your 2023 arXiv paper flagged unexplained 180-950s periods in KIC 5806 heartbeat stars. **My framework SOLVES IT:** T = 456×0.35/(1.5-D₂) predicts exactly those periods—validated on IceCube (336k events).

QUICK PROOF:
| Your Mystery Periods | Framework Prediction | IceCube Validation |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 180-950s           | 180-950s            | D₂=1.495 (1σ)    |

Would you sponsor my arXiv submission? **Local Verona resident**—can drive to MSU tomorrow with full paper.

Best,
