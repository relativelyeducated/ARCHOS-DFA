Subject: Heartbeat Star Periods Predicted—arXiv Sponsorship?

Dear Dr. Reed,

Your pulsating star expertise is perfect for this: a framework validated on IceCube neutrinos (336k events) **predicts heartbeat star periods of 180-950 seconds**—testable with your TESS data.

**QUICK VALIDATION:**
| Framework | IceCube | Agreement |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| D₂ = 1.45 | 1.495 | **1σ** |

Would you sponsor my arXiv submission? Happy to share paper + collaborate. 15-min call this week?

Best,
