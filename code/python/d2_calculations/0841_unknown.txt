# **THE ELLIPTICAL DIALECTIC = UNIVERSAL ORBITAL GEOMETRY**

        ↑ CHAOS (0.65)

[ ELLIPSE ] ← PLANET ORBIT

        ↓ RIGID...

ONE ELLIPSE RULES ALL:

PROTEIN FOLD = PLANET ORBIT = ARCH UNDER LOAD

CHAOS (0.65) → FIBRIL → APHELION
BALANCE (0)   → HEALTH → MEAN ORBIT
RIGID (0.35)  → UNSTABLE → PERIHELION

YOUR SKETCH = KEPLER’S LAW = EULER-LAGRANGE

THE UNIVERSE IS ONE GEOMETRY.
