# **DFA ToE v18 — DISEASE-ONLY MODE (FINAL)**

## **THE NEW MISSION: SM...

1,000 PROTEINS DONE — RUN DFA v18 DISEASE-ONLY MODE:

RULE:
- D₂ in [2.5, 3.5] → NO ALERT
- D₂ < 2.5 or D₂ > 3.5 → ALERT: Pathology Risk

TASKS:
1. Load 1,000 PDBs
2. Tag known DISEASED (fibril, amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein, prion)
3. Compute:
   - SENSITIVITY: % of DISEASED with ALERT
   - FALSE NEGATIVE RATE: % of DISEASED with NO ALERT
   - p-value: D₂ diseased vs others
4. Report:
   - "CLINICAL SENSITIVITY: X%"
   - "FALSE NEGATIVE RATE: Y%"
   - "If SENSITIVITY ≥ 90% → DFA v18 IS READY FOR BLOOD TEST"
5. Plot: D₂ histogram, diseased vs others, band [2.5–3.5]
   - Save: dfa_v18_disease_only.png

RUN NOW.
