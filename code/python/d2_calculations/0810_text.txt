DFA ToE v23 — TWO-STATE UNIVERSE

CONFIRMED:
- 946 Healthy proteins: D₂ = 2.2 ± 0.08
- Scaling: D₂ = 2.0 + 0.15 × log₁₀(N)
- Full-atom extraction: 8.06 atoms/residue

TASK:
1. Download 100 FIBRIL PDBs:
   - Keywords: "amyloid", "fibril", "tau", "alpha-synuclein", "prion"
   - Resolution < 3.0 Å
   - Full-atom
   - N_res > 100
2. Compute D₂ (full-atom)
3. Apply v23:
   - Expected = 2.0 + 0.15 × log₁₀(N)
   - ΔD₂ = D₂ - Expected
4. Report:
   - Mean D₂ (fibrils)
   - % with ΔD₂ > 0.5
   - p-value vs healthy
   - ROC AUC
5. Plot: Healthy (blue) vs Fibril (red) D₂ distribution
   - Save: dfa_v23_two_state.png
6. Write final v23 law in LaTeX

RUN NOW.
