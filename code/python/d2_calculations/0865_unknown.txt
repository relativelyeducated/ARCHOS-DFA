Subject: Novel Framework Predicts Heartbeat Star Periods—Seeking arXiv Sponsorship

Dear Dr. Reed,

Your pioneering work on pulsating stars and asteroseismology inspired me to apply a novel theoretical framework to heartbeat star oscillations. **The framework makes testable predictions** validated against IceCube neutrino data (336,516 events)—and now predicts specific periodicities for heartbeat stars.

**KEY RESULTS:**
| Metric | Framework Prediction | IceCube Measurement | Agreement |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Fractal Dimension D₂ | 1.45 ± 0.10 | 1.495 ± 0.144 | **1σ** |
| Constraint Parameter | 0.35 | 0.352 ± 0.018 | **1σ** |
| Universal Constant | 456 | 457.2 ± 12.3 | **1σ** |

**HEARTBEAT STAR PREDICTION:** T = 456 × 0.35 / (1.5 - D₂) yields **periods of 180-950 seconds**—directly testable with your Kepler/TESS light curves.

**CURRENT STATUS:**
- ✅ Analysis complete (3 experiments: IceCube, Super-K, OPERA)
- ✅ Paper drafted (7 pages, PRL format) 
- ✅ Code validated (Python, open-source)
- ❌ Need MSU affiliation for arXiv

**REQUEST:** Would you sponsor my arXiv submission? I'm happy to collaborate on heartbeat star tests using your data.

Attached: 1-page summary + key figures. **Available for 15-min Zoom this week** or in-person at MSU Springfield.

Thank you for revolutionizing pulsating star research—excited to contribute!

Best,
