CRITICAL: The 1,000-protein set has D₂ ~1.83 due to smaller fragments or Cα-only models.

APPLY DFA ToE v19 — EMPIRICAL 1,000-SET CALIBRATION:

1. Use the 966 valid proteins from the 1,000-set
2. Compute:
   - mean_D2 = 1.827
   - std_D2 = 0.113
   - Normal zone = [mean - std, mean + std] = [1.714, 1.940]
3. Diagnosis:
   - D₂ in [1.714, 1.940] → NORMAL
   - Else → PATHOLOGY RISK
4. Report:
   - % NORMAL
   - TPR: % of 3 fibrils flagged
   - FPR: % of non-fibrils flagged
   - p-value: D₂ (fibril vs non-fibril)
5. Plot: D₂ histogram with [1.714, 1.940] band
