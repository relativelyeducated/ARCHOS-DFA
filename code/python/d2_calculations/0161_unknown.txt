# Context: what do you think of this nuanced perspective data.dat:    1.62 (high) + 1.58 (high) + 1.10 (LOW) = 1.43
IC86-III:    1.51 (mid)  + 1.41 (mid)  + 1.47 (mid) = 1.46
```

**They average to similar value...

**They average to similar values but the BINS DON'T MATCH!**

### **Specifically:**
- **High Energy bin:** 1.10 vs 1.47 = **0.37 difference** (25% off!)
- Only 847 events in data.dat high bin (vs 17,189 in IC86-III)
- Low statistical power in that bin

## 🎯 **What This Actually Shows:**

### **✅ What's Consistent:**
- Both datasets: Low/Mid D₂ are elevated (>1.4)
- Both means near ~1.43-1.46

### **❌ What's NOT Consistent:**
- High energy behavior completely different
- data.dat shows DECREASING trend (1.62→1.58→1.10)
- IC86-III shows FLAT trend (1.51→1.41→1.47)
