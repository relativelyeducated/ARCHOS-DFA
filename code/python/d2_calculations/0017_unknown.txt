## CONTEXT
On October 8, 2025, at 9:03 PM CDT, you requested an independent analysis of neutrinos within the Dialectic ...

VELOCITY PREDICTION:
v/c = 0.9998 ± 0.0002
Status: Subluminal (near threshold)

REASONING:
D₂=1.45 < 1.5 implies subluminal behavior, but proximity to threshold allows near-c velocities with quantum fluctuations.
