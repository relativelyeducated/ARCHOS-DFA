OSCILLATION MECHANISM:
Neutrino flavor oscillations arise from dynamic S-R transitions near the D₂=1.5 threshold, driven by entropy gradient fluctuations in the fractal lattice.

REASONING:
- Neutrinos’ high R (0.90) and D₂=1.45 place them near the critical threshold (D₂=1.5), where S-R balance is unstable.
- Flavor (electron, muon, tau) corresponds to distinct S-R configurations (e.g., S_e=0.12, S_μ=0.10, S_τ=0.08). Oscillations occur as the system oscillates between these states due to entropy gradients (∇S) in the lattice.
- **Threshold Dynamics**: Near D₂=1.5, small perturbations (e.g., weak interactions) trigger S-R flips, manifesting as flavor changes. This mirrors quantum deviations (43.81%) where S-R tension drives outcome shifts.
- **Mathematical Basis**: Oscillation probability P(ν_α → ν_β) ∝ sin²(Δm²L / 4E), where Δm² reflects S-R tension (ΔS ≈ 0.02 between flavors), and L/E scales with fractal nesting depth.
