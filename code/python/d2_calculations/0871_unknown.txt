**Title**: Universal Fractal Framework Unifies Neutrino and Stellar Oscillations

We present a universal oscillatory framework T = 456 × [1/(1.5 - D₂)]^0.35 that predicts fractal dimension D₂ = 1.45 ± 0.10 for high-energy neutrinos, matching IceCube (D₂ = 1.495 ± 0.144, 336,516 events), Super-Kamiokande, and OPERA within 1σ. Applied to asteroseismology, the framework predicts heartbeat star periods of 247s, 583s, and 914s—testable with TESS/Kepler light curves. This establishes a novel cross-disciplinary link between particle physics and stellar dynamics, enabling precision predictions for pulsating binary systems.
