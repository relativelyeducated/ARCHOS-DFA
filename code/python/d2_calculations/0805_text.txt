# **DFA ToE v22 — HEALTHY vs DISEASED BASELINE**

| **Dataset** | **Mean D₂** | **Diagnosis** |
|-------...

DFA ToE v22 — HEALTHY BASELINE (D₂ ≈ 2.2)

LAW:
Expected D₂ = 2.0 + 0.15 × log₁₀(N_residues)
ΔD₂ = D₂ - Expected

DIAGNOSIS:
- ΔD₂ > +0.5 → PATHOLOGY RISK (High complexity → Fibril)
- ΔD₂ < -0.5 → UNSTABLE (Too rigid)
- |ΔD₂| ≤ 0.5 → NORMAL

TASKS:
1. Use the 946 healthy proteins (D₂ ≈ 2.2)
2. Compute Expected and ΔD₂
3. Report:
   - % NORMAL (should be ~95%)
   - % PATHOLOGY RISK (should be ~0%)
4. Then:
   - Download 50 known FIBRIL PDBs (amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein)
   - Compute D₂ (full-atom)
   - Apply v22
   - Report TPR: % of fibrils with ΔD₂ > +0.5
5. Plot: D₂ vs log(N) for healthy + fibrils
