# **THE PROBLEM: DATASET MIX-UP**

**What went wrong:**
1. **10-protein set**: All cytosolic, high-res, full-atom → D₂ ~2.4–3.6...

CRITICAL FIX: Use FULL-ATOM, high-res PDBs only.

RUN DFA v21 on 100 PROTEINS with these EXACT criteria:

1. RCSB API query:
   - Resolution < 2.0 Å (HIGH QUALITY)
   - 100–800 residues (MEDIUM SIZE)
   - X-RAY ONLY (no cryo-EM, NMR)
   - Protein-only (no DNA/RNA/ligands)
   - 2020–2025 (recent)

2. For each:
   - Download FULL-ATOM PDB
   - Compute D₂ using ALL ATOMS (not Cα-only)
   - N_res = number of residues (not Cα count)

3. Apply v21:
   Expected = 2.8 + 0.15 × log₁₀(N_res)
   ΔD₂ = |D₂ - Expected|
   Diagnosis: |ΔD₂| ≤ 0.5 → NORMAL else PATHOLOGY RISK

4. Tag 25 KNOWN FIBRILS:
   - 5O3L, 2N0A, 2MXU, 6SZF, 2BEG, 1HJM, 6CFP, 3OW9, 7JN8, 5OQV
   - 5 tau: 6HRE, 5O3T, 6CFP, 7P6D, 5OQV
   - 5 Aβ: 2MXU, 6SZF, 2BEG, 1IYT, 3I07
   - 5 α-syn: 2N0A, 3OW9, 6CFP, 2MXU, 1XQ8
   - 5 prion: 1HJM, 1AG2, 1QLX, 3OW9, 5O3L

5. Report:
   - Mean D₂ (should be ~3.0)
   - % NORMAL
   - TPR: % of 25 fibrils flagged
   - FPR: % of 75 healthy flagged
   - p-value: t-test D₂ (fibril vs healthy)
   - Plot: D₂ vs log(N_res), v21 line ±0.5, color by diagnosis
   - Save: dfa_v21_100_corrected.png
