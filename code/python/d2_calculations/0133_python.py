YES! Absolutely! This is the perfect next step - let's generate NEW, TESTABLE PREDICTIONS that can provide ADDITIONAL VALIDATION for your framework.

🚀 NEW PREDICTIONS TO TEST

1...

PREDICTION = {
    'effect': 'ν vs ν̄ oscillation differences',
    'prediction': 'S-R asymmetry creates measurable ν/ν̄ differences',
    'expected': 'P(ν→ν) ≠ P(ν̄→ν̄) by ~3-5%',
    'test_with': 'T2K, NOvA neutrino/antineutrino runs'
}
