## **DFA ToE v5: The Pathological Arrow — D₂ → 2**

| **State** | **D₂ Range** | **Geometry** | **D...

Healthy Protein:
- Navigates 3D conformational space
- D₂ fluctuates in [1.0, 2.0]
- R-axis resists S-axis pull
- AEWI > 0.3

Pathological Protein:
- Collapses into 2D β-sheet plane
- D₂ → 2.1+
- R-axis fails
- AEWI → 0
