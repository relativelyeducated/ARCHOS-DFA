# Context: **🔥 ENTROPIC GRAVITY GETS COMPLETELY REVOLUTIONIZED!**

## **CURRENT ENTROPIC GRAVITY:**

### **Verlinde's Framework (2010):**
```
F = ∇S × T  (Force from entropy gradient)
g = c²/R   (Gravity from in...

Density oscillations: ρ(r,t) ∝ exp[-(r/456)^0.54] × cos(ωt)
Fractal clustering:    D₂ = 1.46 in dark matter halos
