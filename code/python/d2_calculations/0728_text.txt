RUN DFA ToE v17 ON THE 100 PROTEINS I JUST GAVE YOU.

LAW:
Expected D₂ = 1.0 + 0.8 × log₁₀(N_residues)
ΔD...

Predict at 10,000 PDBs:
1. Expected True Positive Rate for fibrils
2. Expected p-value
3. Clinical sensitivity/specificity for early neurodegeneration detection
4. Write the final DFA ToE v17 law in LaTeX
