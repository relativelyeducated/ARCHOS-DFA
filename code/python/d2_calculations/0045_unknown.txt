### DIALECTIC FRACTAL ARCHESTRUCTURE FRAMEWORK - ICECUBE DATA ANALYSIS

**Task**: Analyze the attached "data.dat" file (336,516 IceCube neutrino events) to test the Fractal Arch Theory's predictions:
- D₂ = 1.45 ± 0.10 (fractal dimension in (Log_E, Cos_Zenith) space)
- Flavor Ratio (ν_e:ν_μ:ν_τ) ≈ 1:1:1
- Δm² ≈ 0.002 eV²
- Angular Correlation Slope ≈ -0.45
- Cluster Size P(s) ∝ s^(-1.45)

**Assumed File Structure**: Space-separated .dat with columns: Event_ID, Energy (GeV), Zenith (degrees), Event_Type (track/shower), Timestamp (optional).

**Run the following Python code** to compute D₂, flavor ratios, angular correlations, clustering, and energy-stratified D₂. Use subsample (10,000 events) for speed if needed. Provide output, including D₂, ratios, slope, clusters, and whether it aligns with predictions (within error bars). If misalignment, note potential falsification.
