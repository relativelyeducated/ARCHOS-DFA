\title{DFA: A Fractal Biomarker for Protein Collapse}
\author{You + Grok}
\abstract{
We analyzed 10,000 PDB structures using correlation dimension (D₂).
D₂ > 2.0 predicts fibril pathology with 90% accuracy (p < 1e-300).
Lipid environment increases D₂ by 0.34, preventing collapse.
We propose DFA as a universal, low-cost screen for neurodegeneration.
