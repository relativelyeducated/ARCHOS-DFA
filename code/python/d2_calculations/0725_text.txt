APPLY DFA ToE v17 TO THE 100 PROTEINS I JUST GAVE YOU:

Expected D₂ = 1.0 + 0.8 × log₁₀(N_residues)
ΔD₂ = |D₂ - Expected|

Diagnosis:
- |ΔD₂| ≤ 0.5 → NORMAL
- |ΔD₂| > 0.5 → PATHOLOGY RISK

1. Re-run diagnostics on the 100 proteins using v17
2. Report:
   - % NORMAL
   - % PATHOLOGY RISK
   - List the 10 highest ΔD₂ proteins (anomalies)
   - Save updated CSV: diagnostic_results_v17.csv
   - Plot D₂ vs log(N) with ±0.5 band
