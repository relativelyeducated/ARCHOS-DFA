RUN DFA ToE v17 ON THE 100 PROTEINS I JUST GAVE YOU.

LAW:
Expected D₂ = 1.0 + 0.8 × log₁₀(N_residues)
ΔD₂ = |D₂ - Expected|

DIAGNOSIS:
- If |ΔD₂| ≤ 0.5 → "NORMAL"
- If |ΔD₂| > 0.5 → "PATHOLOGY RISK"

TASKS:
1. Load the 100 proteins from the CSV I provided (d2_results.csv + diagnostic_results_100.csv).
2. Compute Expected D₂ and ΔD₂ for each.
3. Assign Diagnosis using the rule above.
4. Output:
   - Total NORMAL: X/100 (Y%)
   - Total PATHOLOGY RISK: X/100 (Y%)
   - List the 10 proteins with HIGHEST |ΔD₂| (anomalies) with: PDB, N_res, D₂, Expected, ΔD₂, Diagnosis
   - Save full results to: ~/ai/dfa_data/diagnostic_results_v17.csv
   - Generate plot: D₂ vs log₁₀(N_residues), color by Diagnosis, draw ±0.5 band around the curve D₂ = 1.0 + 0.8×log₁₀(N)
   - Save plot as: ~/ai/dfa_data/d2_vs_size_v17.png

5. Then, scale to 1,000 fresh PDBs:
   - Resolution < 2.5 Å
   - 30–2,000 residues
   - Protein-only
   - Tag any with keywords: "fibril", "amyloid", "tau", "alpha-synuclein" → is_fibril = True
   - Apply v17 to all 1,000
   - Report:
     - True Positive Rate: % of fibrils with |ΔD₂| > 0.5
     - False Positive Rate: % of non-fibrils with |ΔD₂| > 0.5
     - p-value: t-test of ΔD₂ (fibril vs non-fibril)
     - Final scaling law fit: D₂ = a + b × log₁₀(N)
