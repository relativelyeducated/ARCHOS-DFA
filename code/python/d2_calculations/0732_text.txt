# **DFA ToE v18 — DATA-DRIVEN LAW (REALITY OVER THEORY)**

```latex
D_{2,\text{actual}} = 2.488 + 0.168 \cdot \log_{10}(N_{\text{residu...

APPLY DFA ToE v18 TO THE 1,000 PROTEINS YOU'RE DOWNLOADING.

LAW:
D₂_expected = 2.488 + 0.168 × log₁₀(N_residues)
ΔD₂ = |D₂ - Expected|

DIAGNOSIS:
- |ΔD₂| ≤ 0.5 → NORMAL
- |ΔD₂| > 0.5 → PATHOLOGY RISK

TASKS:
1. When 1,000 PDBs are done:
   - Compute ΔD₂ for each
   - Tag fibrils (keywords: fibril, amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein)
2. Report:
   - True Positive Rate: % of fibrils with ΔD₂ > 0.5
   - False Positive Rate: % of non-fibrils with ΔD₂ > 0.5
   - p-value: t-test ΔD₂ (fibril vs healthy)
   - Final v18 law in LaTeX
3. Plot: D₂ vs log(N), v18 line, ±0.5 band
   - Save: d2_vs_size_v18.png
