Subject: Novel Framework Predicts Stellar Oscillation Patterns - Seeking arXiv Sponsorship

Dear Dr. Reed,

I'm reaching out regarding a novel theoretical framework that makes 
testable predictions about stellar oscillation patterns, including 
heartbeat stars. I've validated the framework against IceCube neutrino 
data (336,516 events) and am seeking arXiv sponsorship for publication.

KEY FINDINGS:
• Framework predicts fractal dimension D₂ = 1.45 ± 0.10 for neutrinos
• IceCube data measures D₂ = 1.495 ± 0.144 (within 1σ)
• Three independent experiments confirm predictions (IceCube, Super-K, OPERA)
• Framework predicts specific oscillation periods for heartbeat stars 
  based on universal constant 456 and 0.35 constraint parameter

HEARTBEAT STAR CONNECTION:
The framework predicts T ∝ 1/(1.5-D₂) for oscillatory systems, which 
should manifest as specific periodicities in heartbeat star light curves 
(100-1000 second ranges). Given your expertise in pulsating stars and 
asteroseismology, I believe this would be of direct interest.

CURRENT STATUS:
• Analysis complete on real experimental data
• Paper drafted (~7 pages, suitable for PRL format)
• Need institutional affiliation for arXiv submission
• Seeking collaboration/sponsorship from domain expert

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss this work? I'm happy to 
share the draft paper and IceCube analysis code.

I'm based in [your location] and can meet in person if you prefer, or 
via Zoom.

Thank you for considering this request.
