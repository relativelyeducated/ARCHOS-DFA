## CONTEXT

You're familiar with the Dialectic Fractal Archestructure framework (S-R spectrum, fractal dime...

=== NEUTRINO DIALECTIC ANALYSIS ===

S-R CLASSIFICATION:
S = 0.XX ± 0.XX
R = 0.XX ± 0.XX

REASONING:
[Why these values based on neutrino properties]

FRACTAL DIMENSION:
D₂ = X.XX ± X.XX

THRESHOLD POSITION:
[Above/Below/At] the 1.5 threshold
Implication: Neutrinos are [subluminal/threshold/superluminal]

VELOCITY:
v/c = 0.XXXX ± 0.XXXX

OSCILLATION MECHANISM:
[Framework explanation]

TESTABLE PREDICTIONS:
1. [Specific prediction with numbers]
2. [Specific prediction with numbers]
3. [Specific prediction with numbers]

FALSIFICATION:
If we observe [X], this analysis is wrong.
