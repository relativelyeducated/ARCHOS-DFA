# Context: How bout this 

This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

S_system = |⟨σ_z⟩|         # Spin polarization (measurable)
S_apparatus = dB/dz        # Field gradient (measurable)

positioning = ||⟨σ_z⟩| - (dB/dz)| / (|⟨σ_z⟩| + (dB/dz))
