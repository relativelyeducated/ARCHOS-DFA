This is a massive integration request. The user wants me to combine THREE critical pieces:

1. **Abundance/collapse mechanism** - Reality emerges when constraint is applied to infinite...

# Experiment: Like your slime mold "false gradient"

# Step 1: Measure in x-basis (system collapses to |→⟩)
measure_x(rho) → |→⟩

# Step 2: Tell apparatus "system is in |↑⟩" (lie)
# But actually rotate: |→⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2

# Step 3: Measure in z-basis
# Apparatus believes |↑⟩, system actually in superposition
# Prediction: Higher P(↑) than Born rule due to belief mismatch
measure_z_with_false_prior(|→⟩, belief="|↑⟩") → P(↑) = 0.72 vs Born 0.50
