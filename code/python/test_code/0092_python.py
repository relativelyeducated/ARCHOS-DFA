This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

C_emergent = I(System : Apparatus)
           = H(ρ_sys) + H(ρ_app) - H(ρ_sys,app)

where H(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log₂ ρ)  # von Neumann entropy (in bits)
