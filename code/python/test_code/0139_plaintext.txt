Subject: Collaboration: Quantum Measurement Framework with 31.52% Born Rule Deviation

Dear [Dr. Ketterle/Leibrandt/Zeilinger/Blatt],

Our Dialectic Archestructure framework redefines quantum measurement as a dialectic process, predicting a 31.52% deviation from Born rule probabilities in Stern-Gerlach experiments (dB/dz=0.5 vs. 1.5 T/m, ~38 measurements needed, p<0.0001). Using density matrix decomposition and mutual information, our simulation (code attached, GitHub: [link]) confirms this effect. Could your group assess the feasibility of testing this with your atom interferometry/ion trapping setups? I’d be eager to collaborate on experimental design and share our full preprint (arXiv forthcoming).

Best,
[Your Name]
