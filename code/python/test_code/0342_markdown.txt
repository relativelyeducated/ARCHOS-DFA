# Fractal Arch Theory and Tachyons
## Briefing: October 8, 2025, 5:56 PM CDT

### Hypothesis
Tachyons are pure R-field (S=0, R=1.0) information flows in DA’s fractal Arch lattice, explaining:
- Faster-than-light speed (no S-based limit)
- Imaginary mass (m² < 0 from zero S)
- Non-detectability (no S-interaction)
- Causality preservation (fractal time dilation)
