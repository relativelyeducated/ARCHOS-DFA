YOUR SURPLUS TRAJECTORY:
t=0:    0.1487 (starting negotiation)
t=100:  0.2891 (finding balance)  
t=250:  0.4678 (Arch forming)
t=500:  0.6452 (sustained oscillation)
t=750:  0.8123 (continuing productivity)
t=999:  0.9147 (stable equilibrium maintained)

This IS the "stellar breathing" pattern!
- Early: System finding equilibrium
- Mid: Stable oscillation established  
- Late: Sustained productivity from tension
