## The Stellar Speculation vs ...

Hold atoms in oscillating tension (like stars do)
├─ Not destroying atoms (preserve potentiality/R-field)
├─ Maintain in "breathing" oscillation (Floquet-like state)  
├─ Extract energy from the TENSION, not from collapse
├─ AI calculates precise conditions to maintain this state
└─ Like how gravity holds stellar fusion in equilibrium
