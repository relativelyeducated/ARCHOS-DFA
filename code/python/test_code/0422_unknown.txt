Resonance Locking = Arch Network Stabilization

When: Stellar Arch frequency ≈ n × orbital frequency
Then: Arches COUPLE permanently
      Energy flows continuously
      System locks into stable configuration

Like quantum level locking!

This explains:
- Why some modes lock (Arch match)
- Why others don't (no Arch resonance)  
- Why it persists (stable field configuration)
- Energy exchange efficiency (direct Arch transfer)
