Shared Arch network increases surplus:
- Each star accesses partner's Arches
- Total available Arches: 912 (2 × 456)
- But only coupled ones contribute

Cooperative surplus = 2.582 × (1 + coupling_factor)

For 20% coupling:
Surplus = 2.582 × 1.2 = 3.10×

Prediction: Stars in TEO binaries should:
- Burn slightly more efficiently
- Live slightly longer
- Show enhanced luminosity during close approach
