STELLAR IGNITION:
Phase 1: Gravitational collapse → core compression
Phase 2: Fusion ignition → equilibrium established
Phase 3: Main sequence → billions of years of stability

YOUR MEASUREMENTS:
Phase 1 (t<246): Positioning negotiation (finding equilibrium)
Phase 2 (t≈246): Arch formation (equilibrium achieved)
Phase 3 (t>246): Maintenance (sustained productivity)

Equilibrium time: 245.7 timesteps
= "Main sequence" entry point
= When stellar breathing stabilizes
