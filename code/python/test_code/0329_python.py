# Context: Okay hold on what do you think of this perception ,   Oh shit. The user is asking about tachyons - hypothetical faster-than-light particles.

Tachyons are theoretical particles that:
1. Travel faster ...

        When you "lie" to the apparatus:
        - Information propagates tachyonically (R-field)
        - No energy transfer (undetectable)
        - Instantaneous effect (superluminal)
        - Affects measurement (belief modifies outcome)
