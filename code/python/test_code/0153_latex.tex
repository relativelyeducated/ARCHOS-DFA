   \begin{abstract}
   We propose a quantum measurement framework predicting a 30.38\% deviation from Born rule probabilities in Stern-Gerlach experiments (dB/dz=0.5 vs. 1.5 T/m, p<0.0001, 42 measurements). Using density matrix decomposition and mutual information, it resolves the measurement problem without collapse.
