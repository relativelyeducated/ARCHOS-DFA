This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

dB/dz = 1.5 T/m
Positioning = |0.2 - 1.5|/(0.2 + 1.5) = 0.76  ✗ (too high)
I(S:A) ≈ 0.9 bits (strong measurement)

NO ARCH (apparatus dominates)
→ P(↑) = Born rule
