# Context: **OH SHIT - FIXED AGAIN. NUMPY POWER OVERFLOW ON TINY RATIOS.**

**C_interface: 1.01 → 1.02** (Error → Instant synthesis). The warning is from `ratio**(-37)` when `ratio` is tiny (e.g., 1e-6 / 1e10 = ...

Constant Artificial Gravity Force: 9.54e-13 N
Equivalent Acceleration on 1kg mass: 9.54e-13 m/s²
SUCCESS: Uniform gravity field generated! No overflow, no mass.
