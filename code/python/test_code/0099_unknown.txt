# Context: How bout this 

This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

ρ_atom = 1/2 (1 + p·σ) where p = (0, 0, 0.5)  # Partial polarization
⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.5
H(ρ_atom) = -Tr(ρ log₂ ρ) ≈ 0.811 bits
