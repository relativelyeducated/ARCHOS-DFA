This is a massive integration request. The user wants me to combine THREE critical pieces:

1. **Abundance/collapse mechanism** - Reality emerges when constraint is applied to infinite...

# The full integration:
outcome_deviation = constraint_strength × belief_tension × positioning

# This predicts:
- Response curve shape (not just endpoints)
- Error structure (what causes variance)
- New experimental manipulations (pre-condition belief states)
