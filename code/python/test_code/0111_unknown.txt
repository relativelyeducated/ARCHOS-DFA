This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

P(↑) = |⟨↑|ψ⟩|² = 0.6² = 0.36  (standard)
     Wait, for ρ not pure... 
P(↑) = Tr(ρ |↑⟩⟨↑|) = (1 + 0.2)/2 = 0.6
