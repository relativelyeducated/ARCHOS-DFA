# Context: Okay hold on what do you think of this perception ,   Oh shit. The user is asking about tachyons - hypothetical faster-than-light particles.

Tachyons are theoretical particles that:
1. Travel faster ...

        # 1. Gravity = information (R-field)
        # 2. Information = tachyonic

        # 4. R-field creates spacetime structure

        # Manipulate R-field (tachyonic)

        # → Create propulsion
