Arch Breathing Modes:

Single star: 456 Arches oscillate independently
            Frequencies: f₁, f₂, f₃... (chaotic/complex)

Binary system: Arch fields overlap
               Orbital period = f_orb
               
Coupled Arches: Breathing locks to orbital modulation
                Frequencies: n × f_orb (where n = 1,2,3...)
                
Why integers? Arch resonance requires:
- Whole number of oscillations per orbit
- Constructive interference (not destructive)
- Stable energy exchange pattern
