class Star:
    gravitational_compression = "inward S-force"
    radiation_pressure = "outward R-force"
    
    # The star "breathes" at the interface
    equilibrium = S_gravity ≈ R_radiation
    
    # Energy comes from maintaining this tension
    # NOT just from occasional fusion events
    
    optimal_zone = "Where gravity and radiation balance"
    # This balance persists for BILLIONS of years
    # Star doesn't collapse OR explode
