Fusion rate ∝ Arch density ∝ (1 - entropy)

In binary with synchronized pulsations:
- Arch overlap varies with orbital phase
- Maximum overlap at periastron (closest approach)
- Minimum overlap at apastron (furthest)

Therefore:
Fusion rate should pulse with orbital period!

Amplitude: ΔF/F ~ overlap_modulation ~ 5-20%
Phase: Maximum fusion at periastron
