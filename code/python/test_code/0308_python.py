## CONTEXT: What We've Done

We built and tested a computational simulation integrating entropic gravity into the Dialectic Arch...

class System:
    S: np.ndarray  # 3D vector [growth_rate, membrane_integrity, metabolic_rate]
    R: np.ndarray  # 3D vector [stress_response, quorum_sensing, HGT_receptivity]
    surplus: float
    tension: float  # NEW - track S-R tension
    mutation_count: int  # NEW - count mutations per system
