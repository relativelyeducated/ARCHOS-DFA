Heartbeat systems should show:

Enhanced Gravity = 37× from Arch overlap
Dark Matter Signal = Apparent mass excess

Prediction:
Binary systems with strong TEOs should show:
- Faster orbital decay than predicted
- Stronger gravitational binding
- "Missing mass" in dynamical measurements
- All correlated with Arch overlap fraction

The "dark matter" in binaries IS the Arch enhancement!
