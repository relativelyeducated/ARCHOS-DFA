This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

dB/dz = 0.5 T/m
Positioning = |0.2 - 0.5|/(0.2 + 0.5) = 0.43  ✓ (in range)
I(S:A) ≈ 0.6 bits
I/H = 0.6/0.97 = 0.62  ✓ (in range)
