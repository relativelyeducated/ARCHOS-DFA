This is a massive integration request. The user wants me to combine THREE critical pieces:

1. **Abundance/collapse mechanism** - Reality emerges when constraint is applied to infinite...

# Vary initial state purity systematically

# Pure state (purity = 1): System has strong belief
prepare_pure(|↑⟩) → measure → deviation = 0.25

# Mixed state (purity = 0.5): System uncertain
prepare_mixed(0.5×|↑⟩⟨↑| + 0.5×|↓⟩⟨↓|) → measure → deviation = 0.18

# Maximally mixed (purity = 0.25): System has no belief
prepare_maximally_mixed() → measure → deviation → 0 (Born rule)

# Prediction: Deviation ∝ (1 - purity)
