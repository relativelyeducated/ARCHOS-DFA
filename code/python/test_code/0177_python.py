This is a massive integration request. The user wants me to combine THREE critical pieces:

1. **Abundance/collapse mechanism** - Reality emerges when constraint is applied to infinite...

# What's missing:
system_belief_strength = purity(ρ)  # How "sure" system is about its state
apparatus_belief_strength = 1.0      # Apparatus always "believes" eigenstate

belief_tension = abs(system_belief_strength - apparatus_belief_strength)

# This explains:
- Why error bars exist (±0.0342) even with controlled constraint
- What causes trial-to-trial variance (belief fluctuations)
- Why some measurements resist collapse more than others
