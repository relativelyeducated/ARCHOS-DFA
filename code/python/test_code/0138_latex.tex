\begin{abstract}
We introduce a novel quantum measurement framework where outcomes depend on system-apparatus positioning and mutual information, predicting a 31.52\% deviation from Born rule probabilities in Stern-Gerlach experiments (dB/dz=0.5 vs. 1.5 T/m). Simulations confirm this effect (p<0.0001), using density matrix decomposition and information-theoretic metrics.
