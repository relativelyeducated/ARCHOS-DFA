# Context: How bout this 

This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

ρ_atom = 1/2 (I + 0.2·σ_z)  # Weak polarization
⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.2
H(ρ_atom) ≈ 0.97 bits  (more uncertain)
