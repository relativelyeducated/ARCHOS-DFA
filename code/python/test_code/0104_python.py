# Context: How bout this 

This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

# For Arch formation, measurement must be:
# 1. Strong enough to create correlation
# 2. But not so strong it's purely extractive

Arch_forms = (0.5 < I(S:A)/H(ρ) < 1.5) AND (0.3 < positioning < 0.7)
