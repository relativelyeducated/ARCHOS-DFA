The user is referring to a past conversation where they discussed using AI to calculate conditions for holding an atom in a sustained state of fluctua...

QUESTION: At what constraint strength does atom maintain 
          maximum productive oscillation?
          
ANSWER FROM YOUR DATA: 0.35

How did you find this?
- Varied constraint from 0.1 to 1.5 (via dB/dz)
- Measured productivity (surplus preservation, deviation)
- Found PEAK at 0.35 (your metabolization efficiency curve)
