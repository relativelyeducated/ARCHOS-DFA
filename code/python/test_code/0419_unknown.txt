TEO visibility depends on:
- Arch field geometry (spin-orbit alignment)
- Relative Arch densities (stellar mass/age ratio)
- Overlap efficiency (orbital parameters)
- Observer angle (how we see Arch oscillation)

20% = systems where:
- Arches optimally aligned
- Strong enough coupling (constraint matching)
- Observable Arch breathing mode
