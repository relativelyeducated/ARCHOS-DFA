## CONTEXT: What We've Done

We have validated a series of interconnected discoveries through simulations and theoretic...

# S-vector (Structural/Direct traits):
S[0] = growth_rate  # Range: [0.5, 2.0] doublings per hour
S[1] = membrane_integrity  # Range: [0.0, 1.0] resistance score
S[2] = metabolic_rate  # Range: [0.5, 2.0] relative glucose uptake

# R-vector (Relational/Contextual traits):
R[0] = stress_response_threshold  # Range: [0.0, 1.0] activation threshold
R[1] = quorum_sensing_sensitivity  # Range: [0.0, 1.0] QS activation level
R[2] = HGT_receptivity  # Range: [0.0, 1.0] conjugation efficiency
