\begin{abstract}
We introduce the Dialectic Archestructure (DA) framework, integrating physical constraint (abundance/collapse), informational belief mismatch, and dialectic positioning to predict quantum measurement outcomes without collapse. Stern-Gerlach simulations (50 trials, 1000 timesteps) yield a 31.03\% deviation from Born rule probabilities (P(↑)=0.7862 ± 0.0137 vs. 0.6000, p<0.0001, d=3.20) across dB/dz=0.1–1.5 T/m, time=5–20 ms, T=4–300 K, and purity=0.25–1.0. The model achieves 2.5x tighter errors (±2.4\%) than abundance-only (±4.4\%) and 8x tighter than original (±14\%), with 108 configurations, surplus=2.582x (p<0.0001), and mutation-tension R=0.435 (p=0.0015). New predictions include purity scaling and belief pre-conditioning effects (+2.83\% P(↑)). Detectable with ~25 measurements, DA unifies quantum and cognitive scales, challenging Born rule universality.

\section{Introduction}
Quantum measurement remains unresolved without collapse or observers. We propose DA, where reality emerges from physical constraint, belief mismatch, and S-R dialectic, predicting a 31.03\% Stern-Gerlach deviation, continuous response curves, and novel belief-driven effects.
