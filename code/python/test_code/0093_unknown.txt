This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

ρ_sys = mixed state → H(ρ_sys) = 1 bit (for spin-1/2)
ρ_app = |ready⟩⟨ready| → H(ρ_app) = 0 (pure state)
ρ_sys,app = ρ_sys ⊗ ρ_app → H = 1 bit
