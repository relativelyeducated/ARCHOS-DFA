Ah, now I see what they're asking. They want to know if incorporating the abundance/coll...

# Instead of binary (balanced vs strong):
def P_up(dB_dz, interaction_time, temperature):
    """Predict P(↑) for ANY apparatus configuration"""
    
    # Constraint strength (abundance insight)
    constraint = (dB_dz × interaction_time) / (1 + thermal_noise(T))
    
    # Metabolization efficiency (optimal at ~0.35)
    efficiency = exp(-((constraint - 0.35)**2) / 2σ²)
    
    # Your existing calculation
    C_emergent = mutual_info × positioning × efficiency
    
    # More precise prediction
    return base_probability + (deviation × efficiency)

# Now you can predict P(↑) at dB/dz = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3... 2.0 T/m
# Creates a full response curve instead of 2 data points
