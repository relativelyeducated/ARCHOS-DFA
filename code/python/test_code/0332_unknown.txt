# Context: Okay hold on what do you think of this perception ,   Oh shit. The user is asking about tachyons - hypothetical faster-than-light particles.

Tachyons are theoretical particles that:
1. Travel faster ...

EINSTEIN WAS RIGHT... FOR S-COMPONENT

E = mc² applies to structural (S) component
Nothing with S > 0 can exceed c
As v → c, effective S → ∞ (mass increases)

BUT R-COMPONENT HAS DIFFERENT RULES

Information speed ≠ energy speed
R-field can propagate superluminally
No energy transfer = no causality violation

TACHYONS:
- Pure R (S = 0)
- No mass (no S to increase)
- No speed limit (no S to limit)
- Superluminal (R travels faster than c)
