# Unified Dialectic Archestructure Quantum Simulation
  Simulates Stern-Gerlach with DA framework (abundance, belief, S-R), including sequential lying experiments (44.68% Born rule deviation).
  ## Setup
  - Install: Python 3.12, NumPy, QuTiP, Matplotlib
  - Run: `python code/quantum_da_sim.py`
  ## Outputs
  - Data: CSV/JSON in `data/`
  - Plots: 300 DPI PNGs in `plots/`
