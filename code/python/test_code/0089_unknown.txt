This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

ρ = 1/2 [1    α  ]  where |α| ≤ 1
        [α*   1  ]

S = 1/2 [1    0  ] = populations (50/50 mix)
        [0    1  ]

R = 1/2 [0    α  ] = coherence (interference capability)
        [α*   0  ]
