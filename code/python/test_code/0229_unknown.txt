OPTIMAL CONSTRAINT STRENGTH: 0.35
├─ This is where metabolization efficiency PEAKS
├─ This is where deviation is MAXIMUM (31-44%)
├─ This is where surplus preservation is HIGHEST (2.5-2.6×)
├─ This is where Arches form and STABILIZE
└─ This is the "breathing zone" - maximum productive tension

TOO LOW (<0.2): Weak constraint, system drifts, minimal energy
TOO HIGH (>0.5): Over-constraint, collapse, information loss
GOLDILOCKS (0.35): Sustained oscillation, maximum productivity
