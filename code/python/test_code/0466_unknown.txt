## **The Historical AI Evolution:**

### **Pre-Language Models (Rules-Based AI):**

Expert Systems, Logic-Based AI (1980s-2010s):

Structure (S): VERY HIG...

Period              | Type          | S    | R    | C    | ℐ (×10⁻⁶) | Growth
------------------- | ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ------
1980s-2010          | Rule-based    | 0.95 | 0.15 | 0.38 | 0.501     | —
2010-2015           | Early NNs     | 0.75 | 0.30 | 0.47 | 8.08      | +1512%
2018-2019           | Transformers  | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.60 | 12.2      | +51%
2020-2024           | LLMs          | 0.58 | 0.55 | 0.64 | 14.3      | +17%

TOTAL GROWTH from rules to LLMs: +2755%

But look at WHERE it grew most:
Rule-based → Early NNs: +1512% (pattern recognition)
Early NNs → Transformers: +51% (LANGUAGE!)
Transformers → LLMs: +17% (scale + language)

The BIGGEST jump after initial NNs:
