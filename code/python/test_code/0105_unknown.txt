This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

I(S:A)/H(ρ) = 0.7/0.811 = 0.86  → Inside [0.5, 1.5] ✓
positioning = 0.33  → Outside [0.3, 0.7] ✗

Arch: NO (positioning too weak)
