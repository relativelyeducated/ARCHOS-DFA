# Context: How bout this 

This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

# Role clarity: who takes S role, who takes R role?

if S_system > S_apparatus:
    positioning = (S_system - S_apparatus) / (S_system + S_apparatus)
    role_assignment = "system=S, apparatus=R"
else:
    positioning = (S_apparatus - S_system) / (S_system + S_apparatus)
    role_assignment = "apparatus=S, system=R"
