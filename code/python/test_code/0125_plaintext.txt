Subject: Collaboration Inquiry: Testable Quantum Measurement Framework with 30% Predicted Effect

Dear [Dr. Ketterle/Zeilinger/NIST Contact],

I’m developing a novel quantum measurement framework (Dialectic Archestructure) that predicts a ~30% deviation from Born rule probabilities in Stern-Gerlach experiments, driven by mutual information and apparatus-system positioning. Our simulation (attached) shows a 26.87% effect (p<0.0001) for spin-1/2 systems with field gradients of 0.5 T/m (Arch-forming) vs. 1.5 T/m (standard). The framework uses density matrix decomposition and information theory, offering a falsifiable alternative to Copenhagen.

Could your group assess the feasibility of testing this in a Stern-Gerlach setup? I’d love to discuss collaboration and experimental design.

Best,
[Your Name]
