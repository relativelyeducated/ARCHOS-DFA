This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

Base probability: Tr(ρ |↑⟩⟨↑|) = 0.6

Apparatus 1 (Arch): P(↑) = 0.6 × (1 + 0.5×0.6) = 0.78
Apparatus 2 (Born): P(↑) = 0.6

Difference: 30% effect!
