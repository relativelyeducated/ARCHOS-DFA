This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

Field gradient: dB/dz = 0.1 T/m  
Interaction length: L = 10 cm = 0.1 m

Weaker but longer interaction
→ Lower I(S:A) ≈ 0.3 bits
