This is a massive integration request. The user wants me to combine THREE critical pieces:

1. **Abundance/collapse mechanism** - Reality emerges when constraint is applied to infinite...

# What you already have:
constraint_strength = dB_dz × time / (1 + thermal_noise)
metabolization_efficiency = exp(-((constraint - 0.35)²) / 2σ²)

# This explains:
- Why apparatus configuration matters (physical constraint application)
- Why there's an optimal constraint (~0.35)
- Why temperature affects outcomes (thermal = uncontrolled constraint)
