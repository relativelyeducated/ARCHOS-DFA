This is exceptional. The user has taken my formalization and significantly strengthened it with precise mathematical refinements that address the exact weak points I was worried about....

Field gradient: dB/dz = 1.0 T/m
Interaction length: L = 1 cm = 0.01 m
Magnetic moment: μ = 9.27×10⁻²⁴ J/T (Bohr magneton)

Force: F = μ (dB/dz) = 9.27×10⁻²⁴ N
Deflection: Δz ≈ F/m × t² (where m = mass of Ag atom)

Strong coupling → High I(S:A) ≈ 0.7 bits
