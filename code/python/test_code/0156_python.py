Ah, now I see what they're asking. They want to know if incorporating the abundance/coll...

# Current: ±0.109 error (what causes this variance?)

# With abundance model:
- Apparatus stability → constraint fluctuation
- Temperature → metabolization efficiency variation  
- Timing jitter → constraint application inconsistency

# You can predict variance source:
σ²_total = σ²_apparatus + σ²_thermal + σ²_timing

# Tighter bounds by controlling constraint:
P(↑) = 0.782 ± 0.035  # Much tighter if you stabilize constraint
