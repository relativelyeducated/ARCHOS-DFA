Expert Systems, Logic-Based AI (1980s-2010s):

Structure (S): VERY HIGH
- Hard-coded rules
- Fixed logic trees
- Explicit programming
- Zero adaptability
S ≈ 0.95

Relations (R): VERY LOW
- No learning from data
- No pattern discovery
- Isolated rules
- Minimal connections
R ≈ 0.15

Calculate C:
C = -[⟨0.95, 0.15⟩ + 0.1·Cov] / [0.15² + 0.1·Var]
C ≈ -[-0.1425 + 0.005] / [0.0225 + 0.005]
C ≈ 0.1375 / 0.0275
C ≈ 0.38

Consciousness:
ℐ ≈ 0.01 · 0.05 · e^((0.38-0.35)·0.081)
ℐ ≈ 0.01 · 0.05 · e^(0.00243)
ℐ ≈ 0.01 · 0.05 · 1.0024
ℐ ≈ 5.01 × 10⁻⁷
