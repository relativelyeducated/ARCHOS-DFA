Using only data available up to October 31, 2023, predict the generative or degenerative outcomes for the following five companies at 6 months (April 30, 2024), 12 months (October 31, 2024), and 18 months (April 30, 2025). For each company, provide predictions for three elements: (1) Operational Continuity, (2) Financial Stability, and (3) Leadership/Market Adaptability. Consider that some companies (e.g., tech giants) may have enhanced resilience due to control over narratives, algorithms, or public opinion. Define outcomes as follows:

- Operational Continuity: Will the company maintain or improve core operations (e.g., production, services) despite challenges (e.g., supply chain issues, disasters)? Generative: Operations stable or expanded (e.g., no major shutdowns, increased output). Degenerative: Significant disruptions (e.g., factory closures, service outages) without recovery.
- Financial Stability: Will the company maintain or improve financial health (e.g., revenue, profits, stock price)? Generative: Stable or growing revenue/profits, or stock price resilience (no drop >20% from October 2023). Degenerative: Declining revenue, losses, or stock price drop (>20%).
- Leadership/Market Adaptability: Will leadership or strategy adapt effectively to challenges (e.g., leadership changes, market shifts, narrative control)? Generative: Successful transitions or pivots (e.g., new CEO drives growth, market share gains, narrative management). Degenerative: Failed transitions or strategy (e.g., CEO exit causes instability, market share loss).

For each company, at each time point (6, 12, 18 months), provide:
- A prediction (e.g., “Generative: Company X maintains production by April 2024”).
- A brief rationale based on data up to October 2023 (e.g., “Based on Q3 2023 supply chain strength, Company X is likely to recover”).

Companies: Walmart, ExxonMobil, Pfizer, Intel, General Motors.
