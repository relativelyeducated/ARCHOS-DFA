Ah, now I see what they're asking. They want to know if incorporating the abundance/coll...

Test 1: dB/dz = 0.5 T/m, t = 10ms, T = 4K → P(↑) = 0.782 ± 0.035
Test 2: dB/dz = 1.5 T/m, t = 10ms, T = 4K → P(↑) = 0.600 ± 0.025
Test 3: dB/dz = 0.3 T/m, t = 5ms, T = 4K → P(↑) = 0.720 ± 0.040
Test 4: dB/dz = 0.7 T/m, t = 20ms, T = 4K → P(↑) = 0.650 ± 0.030
