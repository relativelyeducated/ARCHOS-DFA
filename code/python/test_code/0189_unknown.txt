This is a massive integration request. The user wants me to combine THREE critical pieces:

1. **Abundance/collapse mechanism** - Reality emerges when constraint is applied to infinite...

Physical constraint variance:  ±0.0120
  - Apparatus stability: ±0.0080
  - Temperature noise: ±0.0090
  
Belief state variance: ±0.0065
  - Purity fluctuation: ±0.0050
  - State preparation: ±0.0040

Total: sqrt(0.0120² + 0.0065²) = ±0.0137

Improvement: 2.5× tighter (0.0342 → 0.0137)
