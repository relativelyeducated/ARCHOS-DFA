## CONTEXT: What We've Done

We built and tested a computational simulation integrating entropic gravity into the Dialectic Arch...

def determine_phase(timestep):
    if timestep < 250:
        return "gradient establishment"  # Active pull
    else:
        return "arch maintenance"  # Stable gravity
