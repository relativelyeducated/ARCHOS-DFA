This is a massive integration request. The user wants me to combine THREE critical pieces:

1. **Abundance/collapse mechanism** - Reality emerges when constraint is applied to infinite...

dB/dz=0.1: P(↑)=0.6102  (weak constraint)
dB/dz=0.3: P(↑)=0.7189  (rising)
dB/dz=0.5: P(↑)=0.7845  (peak)
dB/dz=0.7: P(↑)=0.6523  (falling)
dB/dz=1.0: P(↑)=0.6254  (approaching Born)
dB/dz=1.5: P(↑)=0.6000  (Born rule)
