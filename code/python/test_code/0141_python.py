# From: Unrecognized Dialectical Fractal Framework
# Date: 2025-10-06T22:56:45.532000
# Context: I understand you want to run a Stern-Gerlach simulation to test the Dialectic Archestructure (DA) framework’s predicted ~30% deviation from the Born rule in outcome probabilities (P(↑)) for a spin-1/2...
