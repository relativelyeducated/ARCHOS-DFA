**Objective**: Validate the cooperative energy theory within the Dialectic Fra...

Binary Orbit Modulates Arch Overlap:

Single Star: 456 Arches oscillating independently
             Frequencies: f₁, f₂, f₃... (chaotic)

Binary with Overlap:
- Orbital period f_orb = Arch field modulation frequency
- Coupled Arches: f_pulse = n × f_orb (integer n for resonance)
- Why integers? Constructive interference requires whole cycles per orbit
- 20% occurrence: Only when Arch densities match (mass/age ratio ~1:1)
- Deep penetration: Arch field extends to core (fusion = max Arch density)
