## CONTEXT: What We've Done

We built and tested a computational simulation integrating entropic gravity into the Dialectic Arch...

N_TRIALS = 50  # Increased for better statistics
N_TIMESTEPS = 1000
VECTOR_DIM = 2

# DA parameters
ARCH_THRESHOLD = 0.35
COUPLING_FACTOR = 0.1
COHERENCE_DECAY = 0.95

# Darwinian parameters  
MUTATION_RATE = 0.1
BASELINE_MUTATION_PROB = 1e-9  # For tension-driven model

# Tension-driven parameters
TENSION_ALPHA = 5.0  # Amplification factor
