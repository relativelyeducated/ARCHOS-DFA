## OVERVIEW

Per your request, I have executed the improved Dialectic Archestructure (DA) simulation as specified in the ...

class SimulationResults:
    def __init__(self):
        self.surplus_history = []
        self.tension_history = []
        self.mutation_events = []  # (timestep, tension)
        self.arch_log = []

        self.mutation_tension_correlation = 0.0
        self.phase1_mutation_rate = 0.0
